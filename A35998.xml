            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The firſt is a doctrine craftily inſtill'd into the mindes of the
people, upon no other foundation then a miſtake, in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of true and profitable liberty, that the law of Nature doth
juſtifie any attempts to ſhake off thoſe bonds impoſed upon
them by Superiours, if inconvenient and deſtructive of native
freedome: the fallacie of which is eaſily diſcerned by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
men. It is true, if we looke upon the Priviledges of
Nature, (abſtracting from paternall dominion) Freedome is the
birth-right of mankinde, and equally common to every one, as
the Aire we breath in, or the Sun which ſheds his beames and
luſtre, as comfortably upon Beggars, as upon the Kings of the
earth. This Freedome was an unlimited power to uſe our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
according as will did prompt. The reſtraint of which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52023:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would queſtionleſſe have beene very grievous, but that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

they liked, as it was miſerable, to ſuffer as much as it pleaſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to inflict.<note place="margin">The evils which flow from want of Government.</note> For any that was ſtronger then his neighbour
had it in his power to hinder him from injoying the benefits of
liberty; nor yet could the moſt powerfull man among them
take any extraordinary comfort in this as yet hoſtile State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his minde was diſtracted with continuall feares, ſince
there was not any ſo contemptibly weake, but that if he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

though not by force, yet by ſubtilty, and watching advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or at leaſt a few combining might deſtroy the ſtrongeſt,
and might be tempted ſo to doe, for their fuller ſecurity.</p>
               <p>This was their unhappy condition amidſt feares and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,

moſt wicked man; but as knowing the effect of it, an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
and generall calamity will quickly unite multitudes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a people again, and force them to reſtore ſome government;
and they may hope in a new compact to gaine a greater ſhare
in the rule, then their ambition hath beene able to force from
the ſetled Kingdome.</p>
               <p>I will adde the unavoidable occaſions of quarrell, extreamely
oppoſite to the prime dictate of nature, the preſervation of
themſelves, and to the meanes which conduce thereto, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
injoyment of the comforts of this life. For whileſt every
one had right to all, no body could with ſafety make uſe of any
thing; ſince when ſome would take to themſelves what others
delighted in, their deſires and right being equall; there was no
title but that of greater force, which could determine to whom
it ought to belong, and this could not be knowne but by fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and this right reaſon abhorred, as by which men would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

be expoſed to famine in the midſt of plenty, or elſe be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
daily to hazard the loſſe of their lives, out of a naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of conſerving them.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of theſe calamities quickning their underſtandings
to finde out,<note place="margin">The remedy of thoſe evils, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill unity.</note> eaſily prevailed with their wils, to entertaine a
remedy of ſo great evils; which manifeſtly proceeding from
diviſion, the ready cure was to make themſelves one, becauſe no
body is at variance with it ſelfe. There being no way to effect
this naturally, they reduce themſelves into a civill unitie, by
placing over them one head, and by making his will the will of
them all, to the end there might be no gap left open by ſchiſme
to returne to their former confuſion. Becauſe the wills of men,
though the fountaines of all voluntary actions, yet are not
themſelves the objects of choice; (for we cannot will to be
willing, (this would be infinite) but to performe what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded)
and ſo are not capable of being obliged by compacts;
therefore this ſubmiſſion of all to the will of one; or this union
of them agreed upon, is to be underſtood in a politique ſenſe,
and ſignifies the giving up of every mans particular power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his diſpoſall, ſo that he may be inabled to force thoſe who
are unwilling upon ſome private ends, to be obedient for the
common good; otherwiſe they would enjoy the benefits of
others faith in obſerving lawes, and the advantages of their
owne violations and breaches, which may probably be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if penalties be appointed much greater then the profit
which can come by their diſobedience; becauſe, as men are
naturally tempted by hopes of good, ſo they are as naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
by a certaine expectation of greater evils.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo by transferring every particular mans power into
the hands of one, is not meant a reall laying downe and naturall
tranſlation of their ſtrength, (becauſe their nerves and ſinewes
are not alienable, as their money and goods) but a conſent and
mutuall obligation (as of all to one, whether he be King, as in
a Monarchy; or ſome Nobles, for they are one too, as in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy,
ſo of every one to each other) of not uſing their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power, but onely as Law ſhall require, that is, of not reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
that body in which the ſupreame power is placed, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52023:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of aiding him, or them by vertue of that promiſe, or of
that oath, according to the nature of the contract, when be or
they ſummon their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>By what is layed downe, may be diſcovered the weakneſſe
of their ſecond principle (which hath done moſt miſchiefe and
till it be thoroughly rooted out of mens minds the ſeed is ſtill

the foundation upon which rule and Subjection are built, will
appeare not ſo delightfull, as it was neceſſary. And it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
in the workes of Art, <hi>operum faſtigia ſpectantur, latent

ſtrength which ſupports the moſt elegant piles, lies deeply bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the earth, and unregarded. It were very ſtrange, if any
man ſhould be ſo prodigiouſly weake, as to ſuffer himſelfe to be
perſwaded to remove his chambers and galleries into a healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

<hi>Populi ſalus ſuprema lex,</hi> is the Engine by which the

<hi>non jam aedes, ſed cumulus erit,</hi> will be ſoone ſwallowed in
the common confuſion; but this is evidently and demonſtrably
ruined by theſe principles. For government is an effect not of a
peoples divided naturall powers, but as they are united and made
one by civill conſtitution; ſo that when we call it ſupreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
we impoſe an improper name, and have given occaſion for
miſtakes (yet I ſhall not endeavour to alter the common uſe of
ſpeaking, but onely to prevent a miſunderſtanding of it) becauſe
indeed this power is ſimply one, and when it doth expreſſe it
ſelfe by one perſon or more, (according to different formes)
who yet are but ſeverall parts of one governour, there is not left
in the Kingdome or Common-wealth, any civill, that is, any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
power, which can appeare in reſiſtance, becauſe all of them
have bound their naturall hands by a politique agreement.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes, thoſe that will allow any power to
Subjects againſt their ruler (let it be,<note place="margin">Liberty to reſiſt thoſe in whom the Law places <hi>jus gladis</hi> the right of the ſword, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement.</note> one man, or many united

of government, by which they were compacted into
one, and which made a multitude a people, and ſo breake the
Common-wealth into as many peices, as they have ſet up oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
againſt it. For there cannot be two powers and yet the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52023:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kingdome remaine one. This is that, which diſtinguiſhes <hi>Francs</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> from one another, becauſe they have
three powers legally diſtinct, and are the ſame in relation each to
other, as three particular men meeting in ſome wilderneſſe, and
conſidered as not having agreed to any Lawes of Society.</p>
               <p>I am fully perſwaded, no ſober man can imagine the policy of
this State is ſo defective, as to open a neceſſary way to its owne
ruine, that is, to divide the Kingdome legally in it ſelfe; and
therefore it muſt neceſſarily be granted, thoſe that take up armes
being not authorized ſo to do by law, are guilty of rebellion, and
the conſequences of it, murder and rapine. It is very eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
whom the Law hath armed with power, becauſe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the people, not the two Houſes, but the King alone is
ſworne to protect us, which is an evident argument, he is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to effect this end, and that the neceſſary meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
it, which is the <hi>poſſe regni,</hi> is at his diſpoſall.</p>
               <p>By theſe generalls throughly digeſted, and rightly applied,
we ſhall be able to rule particular deciſions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire one thing eſpecially may be remembred, as
which hath great influence upon all caſes. Though what is truly
the right of any one, doth not ceaſe to be ſo naturally by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſentence to the contrary; yet after poſitive conſtitutions,
upon a Judges deciſion, he can challenge no title to it, becauſe by
his owne deed, and conſent, he paſſeth it away in that judiciary
determination. And equity and prudence both dictate, that it
was a moſt honeſt and reaſonable agreement, as conducing to
publique peace, and the quiet of mankind, that perſons publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſtituted and more unconcerned in the deciſions, ſhould
put an end to all debates. Becauſe otherwiſe the controverſie
was not likely to be ended, but with one of the parties; For each
man out of naturall favour (the ſtrongeſt corruptive of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
inclining to his owne Intereſt, there was nothing left
but force to determine it. There cannot be a more unhappy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Juſtice, then when ſtrength is made the meaſure
of right, and when all Iudges are bribed, as paſſing ſentence to
their owne advantage.</p>

               <p>THe following Section ſhall be ſpent in proving the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
by which the conſciences of all Subjects muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>It is unlawfull to reſiſt him, or them, in whom the ſupreame
authority, (that is, all the legall power of the Kingdome) is
placed, and no diſpenſation (grounded upon what perſons ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as inferiour Magiſtrates, or upon any cauſe, as the extreame
abuſe of this power to their oppreſſion) can excuſe ſuch reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the ſin of rebellion.</p>
               <p>Upon this pillar not onely monarchy ſtands firme, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
governements are equally ſupported; the generall reaſon
being applicable, according to the difference in ſeverall
formes.</p>
               <p>In the third Section I will bring the caſe home to our ſelves
by proving this aſſumption; The King of <hi>England</hi> hath this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
power, and then I ſhall leave it to every mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to inferre the concluſion, therefore it is unlawfull to make
reſiſtance againſt their Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Section, I will anſwer all the evaſions (how
plauſibly ſoever founded) which I could meete with in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
writings of thoſe men, who though they ſtrike at the
King downe right and more immediately, yet by plaine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
couſequences they deſtroy all civill ſociety.</p>
               <p>By way of concluſion, I will ſhew, though ſuch a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
as they or any others have yet openly pleaded for, ſhould
be granted lawfull (as when in their owne defence, or when he
that hath the higheſt authority, and is bound by the law of God
and his owne oath, to adminiſter juſtice equally, yet after fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
repreſentations of their grievances, and moſt juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of their great ſufferings, affords no redreſſe) yet this can
be no juſtification of the preſent warre againſt the King, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the Actors in it from being rebels. Becauſe this caſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
not now, as will appeare after a view taken of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas
of this unnaturall, and illegall diviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52023:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The propoſition to be proved is, It is unlawfull to reſiſt him
or them in whom the ſupreame authority (that is, all the legall
power of the Kingdome in order to raiſe armes) is placed, and
no diſpenſation (grounded upon what perſons ſoever, as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
magiſtrates, or upon any cauſe, as the extreame abuſe of
this power to their oppreſſion) can excuſe ſuch reſiſtance from
the ſin of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>I make no queſtion every man will apprehend, that by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
here,<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene not o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beying againſt law; and hoſtile reſiſtance to a lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</note> is meant only hoſtile oppoſition, and not a refuſall
to put unjuſt commands (meaſured by divine or humane laws)
in execution; for the truth is, if they are, or ſeeme repugnant
to Gods law, (for then they are ſo really, in reſpect of thoſe
who have that apprehenſion; <hi>idem eſt eſſe &amp; apparere,</hi> in
this caſe of good and bad: becauſe whatſoever is not of faith is
ſin) we muſt conforme our practiſe to that ſtanding rule, layed
downe by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt Gods law, ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>Deo magis, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hominibus, We ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God rather then men,</hi> we are bound (to uſe <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe)

               <p>One is upon a falſe ſuppoſall,<note place="margin">Objections to the contrary.</note> that at our entrance into civill
ſociety, we ſubmitted) as our wills, by which is meant not the
faculty, but the effects of it, which were in our power, and
which are ſubjected as farre as they were in our power, that
is in all honeſt performances, for <hi>peccare non eſt noſtri juris,</hi> ſo)
our underſtanding, and conſequently, though in our private o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
ſuch actions were unlawfull, yet if commanded &amp; ſaid
by our rulers to be juſt, our publique judgement (which we
had given them right to paſſe upon good or bad) did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them honeſt.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument is, though we thinke ſuch actions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
upon a particular comparing them, with the meaſure
of right and wrong, divine precept, or prohibition; yet from
a more generall raeſon, we thinke this thought of ours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
ſuch actions, to be an errour, and ſo if we doe, what
we thinke in our private judgement God hath forbidden, we
doe <hi>contra opinionem agere, ſed non contra conſcientiam,</hi> practiſe
againſt our opinion, not againſt our conſcience, becauſe that is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52023:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſwayed by this generall reaſon. If when rulers ſay ſuch a thing
ought to be done, I ſay, it ought not, the ſence of it is, I am
wiſer then they. But if I grant them the more able men, I
muſt needes thinke they are likely to make truer judgement,
and ſo am bound to ſubmit to the greater diſcretion, becauſe in
morall differences, which are not capable of demonſtration, I
muſt guide my practiſe by the higheſt probabilities of good. If
ſheepe knew how apt they are to goe aſtray, they would be
content to be guided by the ſhepherd, and therfore governors,
who are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are to direct us in the waies of ſafety. He
that ſhall undertake to be his owne maſter, will have a foole to
his ſcholler; and he that refuſes to follow his guide, and fancies
ſome private turnings, is likely to miſſe his way, and through
many wandrings to come weary to his journeys end.</p>
               <p>A third argument is, to challenge to our ſelves the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good and evill, is the fruit of that bitter root of <hi>Adams</hi>
diſobedience; <hi>Eritis ſicut Dij, ſcientes bonum &amp; malum,</hi> was the
temptation, and the ſinne was, he did eate of the forbidden tree
of <hi>knowledge of good and evill.</hi> He was not content to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with good only, ſubmitting to (that which made
actions good or bad) the command or prohibition of him, who
had dominion over him, but began to examine the juſtice and
reaſonableneſſe of them, and ſo would make himſelfe like the
Law-giver.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> The anſwer hereto is eaſie by diſtinguiſhing thoſe things in which God will require from every one a liberty of judging, 
and a conformable obedience, from things more obſcure, and
which will require a deeper ſearch then ordinary underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
can make.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort are the plaine and familiar truths laid downe
in ſcripture, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> binds us to be ſo confident, that
though an angel from heaven ſhould preach any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
we may not admit it. As likewiſe many morall duties
eaſily diſcerned even by weake apprehenſions. If this were
not ſo, the Apoſtles rule could not lawfully be made uſe of, we
muſt obey God rather then men; and the people would be
bound to follow their blind leaders into the pit of deſtruction.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52023:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For Chriſt tels us both ſhall fall into the ditch. But the Apoſtle
allows them to whom he ſpake, to examine his doctrines of this
nature, by the rule of their owne underſtanding. I ſpeake as to
them which have underſtanding judge ye what I ſay, and
judge in your ſelves, is it comely &amp;c. and in the verſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
doth not even nature it ſelfe teach you &amp;c. This caſe is
clearly decided in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> where we learne, if we
condemne our actions, though in themſelves not blameable, yet
to us they are ſinne. v. 22, 23. Happy is he that condemneth
not himſelfe in that thing which he alloweth. He that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is damned if he eate, becauſe he eateth not of faith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave a generall command in the 5. v. let every man be
fully perſwaded in his owne minde.</p>
               <p>Of the latter ſort are things more intricate, and which
cannot without great difficulty be judged of. Being ſuch for
the moſt part wherein not mens honeſty but their prudence
is exerciſed. And here a ſubmiſſion of judgement is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
As in law caſes to be ſwayed by the profeſſors of it, or
if we build a houſe to be directed by artiſts, or in a tempeſt to
take the moſt probable way of eſcaping, by relying on the
pilots ſteering the ſhip and forbidding unexperienced paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to runne to the helme confuſedly and alter the courſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their ignorance &amp; feares prompt them, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
madneſſe, that they ſhall be acceſſary to their owne
death, if they put their lives out of their owne hands, though
they commit them to ſea-men, whoſe experience hath better
enabled them to avoyd the rockes and the ſhelves: And thus
in civill government, wherein the greater part of men can have
no deepe inſight, to truſt the managery of the publique ſafety,
to perſons wiſer then themſelves, and to bind one another to
performe all offices in relation to this end, according as they
ſhall be commanded by their governours, and not to rule their
law-givers by diſputing the unreaſonablenes of what is injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And to this captivateing of their underſtanding religion
obligeth them; for God is not a God of ſedition, of mutinye,
and confuſion, but of unity, order and of peace.</p>
               <p>The caſe thus reſolved produceth an excellent temper, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52023:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mans obedience; as by which we render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things
which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to God the things which are Gods. Be
ſubject to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake. This
binds univerſally, thoſe only caſes being excepted, which God
expreſſely and evidently reſerves to himſelfe; and in them we
muſt take law from the more powerfull. Feare not them which
kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule, but rather feare
him, which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in Hell.</p>
               <p>This liberty of denying obedience can neither be offenſive
nor dangerous to authority.</p>
               <p>Firſt not offenſive,<note place="margin">No inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies from this doctrine rightly ſtated; God to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed rather then men.</note> becauſe magiſtrates can challenge no
more right over our actions, then God gives them or we our
ſelves had, before we ſubmitted them to their commands;
which was none in this ſuppoſed caſe, becauſe a diſhoneſt deed
<hi>non eſt noſtri juris</hi> is not in our power. We can no more paſſe
away by promiſe Gods right to our obedience, then we can
covenant to transferre and give away another mans goods or
demeaſnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is harmeleſſe in the conſequences, becauſe if any
out of a reall or ſeeming repugnance to divine precept, deny
active obedience, they muſt confeſſe themſelves obliged by the
ſame conſcience of obſerving the law of God, not to reſiſt that
authority, which he hath armed <hi>jure gladij,</hi> with the right of
uſing the ſword, probably to this end that Religion might not be
a cloke for Rebellion, &amp; that we might not dare out of the feare
of God to violate the order of divine providence; by which he
hath thought fit to governe the world. This is the patience of
the Saints, which ſhall be rewarded with heaven, becauſe they
ſuffer, rather then doe evill for earthly conſiderations, as being
aſſured, God hath forbiden them, though for prevention of
their particular and undeſerved miſery, to diſturbe the publike
happineſſe, by reſiſting that power, which Scripture tells them
is from above. It oft times pleaſes God to make uſe of ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and their unrighteous judgement may be his juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for our former tranſgreſſions; if it be his will to ſcourge
us by them, no ſmart, ſhould tempt us to cut his rod in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52023:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Becauſe generally men are hardly brought to entertaine a
truth, which ſeemes diſadvantageous to them, and comes in ill
company, attended with affliction, <hi>Quis enim facilè credit,
propter quod dolendum eſt?</hi> (though this ſhould not be amongſt
Chriſtians who are <hi>crucis candidati, &amp; quibus frui fas eſt Diis
iratis,</hi> and who ought to rejoyce in their preſent ſufferings, as
the exerciſe of vertue, and that way to eternall glory, which
our Saviour hath chalked out both by example and precept?)
I will uſe the greater diligence in evidencing this point by all
kinde of proofes, of which the matter is capable.</p>
               <p>If we looke backe to the law of Nature, we ſhall finde that
the people would have had a clearer and more diſtinct notion
of it, if common uſe of calling it <hi>Law</hi> had not helped to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
their underſtanding, when it ought to have beene named
the <hi>Right</hi> of nature;<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Law of Nature and Right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> for <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> differ as much as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

ſignifying, we may equally chooſe to doe or not to doe without
fault, whereas <hi>Lex</hi> or law determines us either to a particular
performance by way of command, or a particular abſtinence by
way of prohibition; and therefore <hi>jus naturae,</hi> all the right of
nature, which now we can innocently make uſe of, is that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not which any law gives us, but which no law takes
away, and lawes are the ſeverall reſtraints and limitations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
liberty. Upon this ground I have ſhewed already the
right of nature cannot be pleaded againſt poſitive conſtitution,
that being a permiſſion onely, and not an injunction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ceaſing by a ſubſequent obligation ariſing from promiſe

               <p>I was unwilling to weary the Reader by an unprofitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and different ſtating of the originall of power. For

my adverſaries would not betray ſo much want of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to make this favour of joyning iſſue upon their owne
principles, a contradiction. For I thought it loſſe of time to
inſiſt upon their miſtakes in the manner of derivation of power,
when all of us agree well enough in the thing. That, after the
multiplying of mankinde, there was an Anarchy is confeſt, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they impute it to a want of all Law and Rulers, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
it more naturally from the multitude of Governours, whoſe
wills being various, were ſo many diſtinct Lawes to thoſe who
were under them, when in every family was a Kingdome.

Though they had abſolute power, yet it was confined within
a narrow compaſſe, and if they exerciſed any juriſdiction, or
made uſe of their liberty to the prejudice of neighbour States,
this begot controverſies, and both parties having right to be
Judges in their owne cauſes, they made force the meaſure of
deciſion, and who was ſtrongeſt could not be knowne, but by

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52023:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
while they lived in this hoſtile State, evidently occaſioned by
their divided powers, a way was found out by making their
individuall ſtrengths, and the many narrow authorities (which
ſtill juſtled one another) one legall power, and this was placed
then with great prudence in one perſon, to the end the cauſe of
their ſufferings might be fully taken away, and that there might
not be left a poſſibility of relapſing into their former miſeries,
which proceeded from oppoſition between equall authorities.
Thus I grant to them their owne Scheame, yet without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to that truth delivered by <hi>Cedren,</hi> who makes <hi>Adam</hi> the

               <p>As reaſon firſt repreſented to them Monarchy, as the moſt
perfect forme, (from which their want of government was a
defection, for we may ſay of Anarchy, <hi>Non fuit ſic ab initio)</hi>
ſo ſenſe confirmed it, they having happy experience of thoſe
eminent advantages peculiar to this conſtitution, as unity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
and expedition. The <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory doth approve this
wiſedome, by acquainting us with the fatall miſcarriages, and
bad ſucceſſes of their Armies, when commanded by two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.
And if we looke upon this State in peace, we ſhall finde
by putting downe Kings they laid the feed-plot of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miſerable civill warres, with which that people was ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
ſo extreamely afflicted.</p>
               <p>The forme of that Commonwealth was Democraticall;<note place="margin">The governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rome</hi> according to the forme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraticall; but according to the practiſe, an illegall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> but
if wee judge of it, not as eſtabliſhed by Law, but according
to the practice almoſt in all times, we muſt pronounce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
an illegall Monarchy. For either ſome one man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
the Senate, and made them an inſtrument to oppreſſe
the people, or elſe (according as it was apteſt to advance his
intereſts) ſiding with the people, and telling them the Nobles
took too much upon them,<note place="margin">Different judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the beſt forme of governement, oft-times the cauſe of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he by their power compaſſed his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>The truth is, the different judgement of the beſt State, doth
<hi>de facto</hi> open a gap to ſedition, becauſe men naturally deſire to
live moſt happily, and are eaſily tempted to contribute their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to any change, which they fancy for the better;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52023:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though in right it ought not to be ſo, notwithſtanding ſome
forme might be propoſed, which were really more perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our faith once given to the preſent government, cannot
be recalled; this civill union is as faſt tyed as the marriage knot,
we are bound to take it for better for worſe. And if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
States would probably be ſhorter liv'd then men, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their foundation on the ſands, that is, on the inconſtant
wills of the people, who are blowne about with every winde
of contrary diſcourſes.<note place="margin">Fallacy in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement is beſt.</note> But in this diſpute concerning the beſt
forme of civill ſociety, there is a great fallacy, as yet not fully
diſcovered. Schemes are drawne in ſpeculation, and politique
diſcourſes are framed, which beare much reſemblance with
ſome figures of Mathematicians, which are made with much
eaſe upon paper, and with apparence of ſolid demonſtration,
ſo that the Schollers not able to object againſt it, entertaine it
for certaine knowledge. But when reduced into practice in
wood or ſtone, the failings are preſently ſeene, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
appeare vaine and unprofitable, becauſe they did
not take into conſideration the capacity of the Subject, on
which they were to worke, nor fore-ſaw what reſiſtance the
matter would make. This errour is committed in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of States, and many plauſible reaſons are laid down for the
rule of the Nobles, or of the people; which are beſt confuted
by experience. For when it is debated, whether Monarchy be
the moſt convenient government, the true ſenſe of it is this,
(if we judge according to the frequent practice, which in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques
is made the moſt reaſonable meaſure of Lawes) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people will live more happily when Law places the
ſupreame power in one, and nominates that perſon (by which
no roome is left for diviſion) or when one man being more
active and crafty then his fellowes, who ought to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
ſhare in this authority, raiſes a faction upon plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and under colour of ſerving his ſide, perſwades them to
be commanded by him, and ſo exerciſes the ſupreame power in
an illegall way: which as it is compaſſed by ingaging the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to make good by force, what Law cannot juſtifie.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder, (for it is no ſtrange thing, part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould be unwiſe) that ſome ſhould be induced to caſt off
Monarchy. They are told, it is very unreaſonable that one

They may upon the ſame ground perſwade them to quarrell
with God Almighty. Their meaning is (though they dare not
ſpeake out) there is no government good, unleſſe they have a
ſhare in it. This intereſt of being joynt Soveraignes, makes
them unable to ſee, or elſe willing to diſſemble the apparent
dangers which diviſion threatens, as likewiſe the great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which wait on ſlow proceedings, (counſels, as well
as men, growing weake by age) and the unhappy miſcarriages
of brave undertakings, becauſe not managed with fitting ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
All theſe three are plainly ſpoken in many Governours,
Faction, Delay, Openneſſe.</p>
               <p>The method whereby the peoples affections are poyſoned,

brought firſt to deſire, then to attempt an Innovation, is this.
All the defects (how unavoidable ſoever, by reaſon of ſecret
lets and hinderances not to be fore-ſeene, as depending upon
many circumſtances, which are variable according to other
mens wills, and which they have not the honeſty to put the
people in minde of) are with great care repreſented to their
conſiderations, and much diligence is uſed to ſet before them a
perfect Catalogue of what ever faults have beene committed
by inferiour Magiſtrates and under Officers; and as they have
excellent memories in repeating grievances, ſo they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
an art (very convenient for their ends, and for creating a
miſunderſtanding betweene King and people, that they may
manage the diſcontents of the Subject to advance particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes)
to forget the ſeverall ſatisfactions given by Princes,
when upon generall complaints, they are fully inſtructed in their
Subjects ſufferings.</p>
               <p>The next worke is to aſſigne ſuch a cauſe of theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52023:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as ſhall open a way to the alteration they aime at, which is,
to impute them to the nature of a monarchicall government, by
telling them, their happineſſe is built upon a very uncertaine
foundation, the will of one man, and if he be bad, they muſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be miſerable.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, a promiſe is made, of healing all their evills, and the
remedy is, <hi>multitudo medicorum</hi> (the ſame plauſibilities may be
urged to perſwade an entertainment of many Phyſicians about
a ſicke perſon, as about a diſtempered State, but experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
theſe reaſons, and hath demonſtrated the danger of it) they
muſt place the Soveraigne power amongſt many, to the end, if
one ſhould faile of his duty, others may ſupply it, if one ſhould
be willing to oppreſſe, others may be able to protect them. It
fares with men in the diſtempers of State, as in thoſe of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
They are eaſily induced to make triall, of what any man
tells them will do them good, and they have the ſtrongeſt phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to thoſe things of which they have leaſt experience. But the
Fallacy which abuſes the people is <hi>non cauſa pro cauſâ;</hi> there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  </gap>ties muſt have an influence upon every ſtate. This
tampering with the Body to reduce it to perfect health, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
many excellent conſtitutions, and ſuch kind of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
proves the moſt dangerous diſeaſe. Wherefore we muſt
not fall out with our ſelves upon every diſtemper, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinke of altering our naturall habit, leſt we make our ſelves
well, only as dead men are ſo. It may become State-doctors to

               <p>It will concerne us in prudence to take that courſe which will
convay to us the greateſt goods, and is the moſt probable way
of avoiding the moſt evills. And this I conceive monarchy is
moſt likely to effect, and I make no doubt the people would be
of the ſame opinion,<note place="margin">Fallacie of une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> if their affections had not beene craftily

they ought to be ſuppoſed both good,<note place="margin">Greater hores in Monarchy; greater feares in an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> or both bad, and then a
true judgement might be made of the miſcheifes and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
Then we ſhould clearely diſcerne, we have greater hopes
under a vertuous King, (ſuppoſe both good) and greater feares
under a vicious nobility or Senate, (ſuppoſe both bad) And
beſides there is one very conſiderable circumſtance, which ought
to rule much in the deciſion; it is much more probable we ſhall
have a good King, then a good nobility. (I take good in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
ſenſe, for that only concernes the preſent diſpute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it in this notion, as providing for the peoples happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.)
Becauſe his intereſt is the ſame with that of the People,
which is ſtrong State ſecurity;<note place="margin">Kings intereſt the ſame with the peoples; that of Nobles divided from their happines.</note> whereas that of particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and much more of men of lower ranke, where ſuch are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
is divided from the publique happineſſe. The Common-wealths
of <hi>Greece</hi> will afford many examples of perſons ſelling
their Country, and putting the great Councell upon ill attempts,
and labouring with their utmoſt cunning to fruſtrate good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
becauſe their dependance upon a forraigne Kingdome or
State, was worth much more unto them, then they could hope
to gaine by honeſt ſervice to their Country.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we have greater hopes under a vertuous King: becauſe
upon ſuppoſall that both be willing to promote the peoples
happineſſe,<note place="margin">Much greater happineſſe in Monarchy.</note> yet he is more able to compaſſe that end, by reaſon
he hath a more united power, and the execution of what ever
deſignes, depends but upon a ſingle reſolve, and therefore may
be managed with certaine cloſeneſſe, and all convenient ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo that good counſells ſhall be firſt diſcovered in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:

               <p>Subjects living under good Lords or Senators (ſuch as value

to me to be in the ſame ſtate, as children who have loſt a father,
and whoſe fortunes by his care are left to Feoffees in truſt; theſe
though extreamely honeſt, yet by reaſon of neceſſary particular
cares, which more immediately concerne them, and becauſe

be carefull to performe this truſt, and therefore he may be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

to a dead man being a very barren vertue, either the wages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
payd before, or elſe nothing allotted. He preſuming upon
their goodneſſe, and frequent deep Proteſtations of loving his
equall to themſelves, and thinking it an unworthy thing, to ſet a
price upon an old friends fidelity, and ſo leaving it to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely by heaven, and the ſame honeſt care in others of their
children; Theſe I ſay out of reall or very plauſible hinderances,
are forced to neglect the childrens portions, and the poore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans
receive uncomfortable ſatisfaction. They would have
beene in much better condition, though ſtrangers in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
if wholely left unto themſelves, becauſe their neceſſities
would have quickned them, whereas now their hands are tyed
up from helping themſelves, and all they can contribute towards
making themſelves Maſters of their owne fortunes, is a fruitleſſe
impudence in vainely importunating the curators: So is it moſt
times in the government of many, though underſtanding, and
good men; which is a rare happineſſe, and yet no ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Greater miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie.</note> we have greater feares under vicious Lords or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators;
That is, it ſtands with cleare and evident reaſon, we

                  <note place="margin">Monarchy a more healthy conſtitution.</note> are examples of this ſad truth. That
which makes a people out of love with monarchy is a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the miſerable conſequences of abuſed power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52023:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the government by Senate is more apt to degenerate, and the
oppreſſions under it are more intolerable.</p>
               <p>As there are many advantages peculiar to Monarchy, ſo there
is not any one inconvenience to which a people living under

a much higher degree.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe a Prince to be luſtfull, or cruell, or covetous,

may be ſafe by diſtance, and live out of the reach of one
mans embraces: If his looſe deſires are ſo inſatiable, how can
they weary thoſe of ſo many? Secondly, it is more eaſie not
to incurre the hatred of one, whereas there are ſcarce poſſible
wayes of complyance with ſo many croſſe humours. One will
never fall out with all, for he knowes he ſhould have an ill
match of it, whereas the whole State may ſuffer by cruelty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed

reines to his revenge, as thinking it ſafe enough, the feares from
a few perſons cruſht by him, being below the delight of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
his power in his enemies calamity. Thirdly, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
of Senators is more devouring, becauſe we may feed
one fire with leſſe expence of fewell, then a hundred. And
fourthly a Princes profuſe ſpending upon favourites is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over-ballanced by ſo many providing for their poore kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

(very neceſſary to all men imployed in State affaires, who are
ſubject to various cenſures) of underpropping their reputation,
and hiring Advocates to plead for them in their abſence, muſt
draw out very conſiderable ſummes, and be more chargeable to

of one man, though ſhowred downe over-plentifully upon

and of the calamity and woes which probably attend an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.
For the cauſe of thoſe miſeries foretold is plainly this,
A King during his infancy being not able to rule, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is managed by the nobles. Whence we learne, that
change which the people oft times with ſinfull earneſtneſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52023:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for, is to be found in the catalogue of Gods judgements,
and they ſue for, and by wicked arts endeavour to compaſſe
their owne puniſhment. It is an argument of Gods great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to them, that he fights againſt them; if he were thoroughly
angry, the deſignes of innovatours would have better ſucceſſe.
This truth is warranted by ſcripture. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a
land, many are the princes thereof: but by a man of underſtanding
and knowledge the ſtate thereof ſhall be prolonged.</hi> prov. 28. 2.</p>
               <p>To all theſe corruptions a popular ſtate is more ſubject,<note place="margin">Popular forme the worſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> and
the imperfections of it, are ſo much the greater, as it is farther
diſtant from monarchy; the temper of it (which is unity, the
ſoule of government) being more eaſily diſſolved. Thoſe
which cry it moſt up, will be unwilling to admit it in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
which are ſmaller principalities. Three things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have made it ſo taking with the vulgar. 1. a pretended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
adminiſtration of juſtice; 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. an empty name of liberty;
and 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> the ſo much applauded equality, by which they ſeeme
to reduce their civill conſtitutions to the primary lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which gave to all men a common right.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt,<note place="margin">More equall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice without reaſon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, promiſed in this forme</note> their hopes that juſtice ſhould be more
equally adminiſtred, are grounded upon this probability: It is
very hard to corrupt a multitude into favour or reſpect of
perſons; (though ſome rivers have beene infected, the ocean
cannot be poyſoned.) A man may ſatisfy the intereſts of one
or ſome few, but to buy injuſtice of ſo many would be no thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trade, he might more cheaply looſe his cauſe. This is a
plauſible but very fallacious argument. Becauſe experience
makes it evident, that to prevent the evills of diviſion, which
the many following particular and croſſe intereſts doe beget,
one remedy is conſtantly made uſe of, which is this; ſome few
of the more crafty citizens, who have gained credit with them,
agree together in private, &amp; order buſineſſes at their cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
and ſo undiſcernably lead the multitude on to what ever
they call the publike good, of which they having prevailed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
their affections are eſteemed the moſt competent Judges.
And what is this, but to pretend to a Democracy, and be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by an illegall Ariſtocracy? By this meanes any one of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52023:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Junto (for they muſt gratify each other mutually) is enabled
to ſtop the courſe of law in a friends behalfe, and to put a ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
edge upon the ſword of juſtice when it ſtrikes an enemie.
Theſe kind of men have got the Art of changing the peoples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of juſt and unjuſt, according as it is more ſuitable to
their owne profit, and they are not ſo much beholding to any
ſolid wiſedome for it, as a kind of frothy eloquence, which
wee may obſerve in their ſet ſpeeches and declamations,
with much cunning fitted to the capacity of their auditors.
They do not at all trouble themſelves to ſatisfy reaſonable men,
for they are but a few, and can ſtand them in little ſtead, where
things are carried by the greater number, and reaſons are not
weighed, but told. The art is, to apply their harangues to that
which rules weaker men, the affections <hi>(ſuadendo docent, non
decendo ſuadent)</hi> and theſe are eaſily convinced, and made the
meaſure of their judgement; the want of weight in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
being ſupplyed by an extraordinary love to the concluſion.
It was too truly ſaid in reference to theſe popular deciſions.

               <p>From this fountaine ariſe the many debates amongſt men in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
affaires. For in Mathematicall knowledge, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
not <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> there is an unanimous conſent; all
agree, what lines are ſtreight, and what crooked; but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of right and wrong, are as various as their intereſts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.<note place="margin">The objection of greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning liberty, it is very ſtrange that men
ſhould ſo generally fall in love with a bare ſound, and court a
name of freedome, which duely examined, will be found to
ſignifie nothing. They cannot meane by it a looſeneſſe from all
lawes, becauſe their intent is to change, not take away govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they dare not owne ſuch a pernicious licence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the true debate amongſt men is, not whether they ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of bonds, (that is ſuch obligations as lawes lay upon them,
theſe are readily embraced) but who ſhall impoſe them; the
queſtion is not <hi>an ſervirent, ſed an uni vel pluribus,</hi> and it is
commonly called liberty, to ſerve more maſters.</p>
               <p>The reſtraint of our freedome is that which is moſt valuable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52023:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amongſt the benefits of government. For this preſerves peace
between men, that their hands are tyed up from doing injuries.
Though we naturally delight in a full and abſolute liberty, yet
the love of it is over-ballanced by feares; every one could wiſh
to retaine it himſelfe, but not upon this condition, that all others
ſhould enjoy the ſame freedome. Becauſe as the contemplation
of our owne liberty is pleaſant, to do what we liſt, ſo there is a
more ſad conſideration ariſing from the thought of others free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to make us ſuffer, as much as they may be tempted to inflict.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Aequalitate ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt iniquius</note> concerning equality, if they urge, it comes nearer to
the law of Nature, by the ſame reaſon they muſt diſſolve the
bonds of all government, ſince there can be no Magiſtrate, no
Superiour and Inferiour, and <hi>par in parem non habet imperium;</hi>
ſo we muſt indulge to every man to doe what ſeemeth good in
his owne eyes. This argument doth not conclude for one forme
above another, but equally deſtroyes all, and is applyed to a
popular State, onely out of reſemblance of ſome imperfections
common to both, becauſe that governement comes neareſt to
none, and is but few degrees removed from Anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
But the truth is, this equality which they ſo paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affect, is clearely againſt nature, who if an equality of rewards
had beene intended, would have made all men equally deſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Reaſon doth teach us, ſince it is manifeſt, we may excell
others by education and induſtry; greater incouragements
ſhould be allotted, in conſideration of the charges of good
breeding, and of the extraordinary ſtudies, whereby men enable
themſelves for the honour and good of the publique. Beſides
this equality, though pretended to conſerve, doth in truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
amity, for none are ſo quarrellſome, none ſo ſubject unto
envy, as equals.</p>
               <p>We may judge of the thriving of popular States, by what
we obſerve in commons, which are alwayes poore, and bare,
and if taken into one mans hands, would be improved foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
we finde by experience what all ſhould looke after, is
neglected by every one, whileſt each man thinkes his particular
expence of time and ſtudy will not conduce much, and that they
may be ſupplyed by others, and therefore he chooſes to imploy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52023:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them rather on his private intereſts much more profitably.</p>
               <p>Seeing that the greater part of men in a popular ſway, are
bred up to gaine, they make profit for the moſt part of the rule of
their actions, and ſo entertaine but little ſenſe of honour. And
hence this State is eaſily corrupted by their low affections, ſo
that particular perſons may be ſometimes rich, the State can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be glorious. How can the happineſſe of that Common-wealth
be laſting, where the wiſer and honeſter part being ſtill
the fewer, muſt be ruled by men of weake underſtandings, and
of corrupt affections, men extreamely violent, if they be not
awed, and in their feare irreſolute in all their proceedings, men
not capable of ſecrets, ſo that they expoſe themſelves to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages?
Their aſſemblies are full of inconſtancy and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it is very hard to ſeparate tumult and multitude. The wiſer
oft times dare not ſpeake, fearing the madneſſe of the people.
For if things ſhould ſucceed ill by ſome ſecret lets, they are ſure
to ſuffer for the event, ſince amongſt ſuch Judges it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to counſaile prudently, unleſſe fortunately alſo. The
States of <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> will afford plenty of examples.</p>
               <p>If they be not united by feare of a forraigne warre, they will
quickly breake out into a domeſtique. They are well compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the raging of the waves; their contrary humours eaſily
raiſe a tempeſt. The united Provinces are thought by many to
owe more to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conſtant enmity, then to the aides
of <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> or <hi>French.</hi> (And yet without their aſſiſtance
they had beene long ſince ſwallowed up,) and they may thank
the juſtice of Monarchies, that theſe friends made them not a
prey to themſelves. He is a ſtranger in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, who
knowes not how fatall Mercenaries were, when lent by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
If he would not have fought with them, he had
conquer'd them long ere this. The fate of <hi>Greece</hi> would have
beene theirs, <hi>Graeciae civitates dum imperare ſingulae cupiunt,
omnes imperium perdiderunt:</hi> we ſee how the <hi>Athenians, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians,
Thebans, Arcadians, Phocians, Locrians, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
Boeotians,</hi> with others, variouſly ſiding, that they might
keepe the ballance even, miſerably warred upon one another,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52023:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
till at laſt <hi>Philip</hi> tooke advantage of their diſcords, and made
himſelfe King of all.</p>
               <p>I have beene tempted into this large digreſſion, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
ſatisfaction of the people, in whom a diſlike of the preſent
government is begot, and ſo a way is laid open for a change of
it, upon pretence ſome other forme would be more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Which firſt is not true, and therefore they have not any
motive for diſloyalty, ſince they would be diſhoneſt againſt
Intereſt. And ſecondly, if it were true in it ſelfe, yet it is not
ſo, when a State is ſetled under another forme, the certaine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of a civill warre, and the great difficulties of ſetting it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
when it is torne into ſo many pieces, will be above any
hopes they can reaſonably propoſe to themſelves. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if it could be done advantageouſly and ſafely, yet it cannot
honeſtly. They will forfeit Heaven for that, which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
will make them more miſerable upon earth; and it were
a ſad purchaſe, if they ſhould obtaine as much as their ambition
or covetouſneſſe can devoure. Civill ſociety is founded upon
Juſtice, and ſupported by Religion, which obligeth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the faith of contracts intire. We are bound to ſtand to
our bargaine, though it ſhould appeare it might have beene
better made. Experience ſhewes us, that States may live and
flouriſh too under the worſt forme of government, and they
are not immortall under the beſt. Let the imperfections be
more or leſſe in this or that kinde of regiment, they cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the Subjects conſcience; though he may have reaſon to
preferre other Lawes, he muſt have ſo much religion to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to thoſe under which it pleaſed God to place him.</p>
               <p>It is high time to make particular application of the former
diſcourſe, concerning the originall of government, and by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſtate of it to give light to all which followes.</p>
               <p>

goodneſſe; or by conqueſt, attended with a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
upon feares from his extraordinary power, that he may be
willing to protect, who was able to injure: whether of theſe
motives preſented the perſon, is not certaine in the firſt times,
but it is cleare their Empire was abſolute (I exclude not the
bounds of juſtice according to the Lawes of right reaſon, and
equity) uſually knowne by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in which
<hi>arbitria principum pro legibus erant.</hi> Though this continued
long in the world, and the Eaſterne people enjoyed a great
meaſure of happineſſe under it, and therefore with great reaſon
(to uſe the expreſſion of <hi>Tacitus) addictè admodum regnaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
they were ſubject moſt devoutly; yet the ſenſe of ſome
ſufferings (as the fate of humane things is interwoven with a
mixture of good and evill) ſuggeſted a remedy, which was to
bound his power within the limits of poſitive Lawes. From
hence proceeded the different qualifications of Regall power
in ſeverall Kingdomes. Some, though reſtrained by Lawes, yet
were truly Monarchs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being not reſponſable
for any breaches, as ſupreame, though not abſolute: others had
the name and title of Kings only, but were ſubject to a ſuperiour
juriſdiction, as <hi>Theſeus</hi> to the people, the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings to the
<hi>Ephori,</hi> It is not neceſſary to determine that queſtion, whether
the frequent debates about the not obſervation and the breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of theſe agreements, (which, a diſcontented part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
challenging the liberty of being Judges in this caſe, and the
King thinking he had as much right, did produce civill warres,
and moſt unnaturall diſtractions) have not heretofore, and will
probably hereafter make States more unhappy then they were
even in their worſt times, and when they ſuffer'd moſt under
the abuſes of one mans power, whileſt there was, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an unjuſt, yet alwayes a certaine way of ending contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies;
when a ſentence, if it did not finde, yet made a right,
and <hi>res judicata pro veritate accipiebatur.</hi> To decide this, I
ſay, is not altogether neceſſary, becauſe the obligations which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52023:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lye both on King and people have their ſtrength from this, not
that he might better governe the people in ſuch or ſuch a way,
but becauſe this particular government is eſtabliſhed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of both parties; their wills give the forme to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not the conveniences of it. To come nearer home,
and grant as much as reaſonable men, and thoſe which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the nature of government can require. For I thinke they
doe ill ſervice to the cauſe, though with good affections, who
out of a deſire to make it more firme and ſtronger, place it upon
any other then the naturall foundation, and that which is onely
fit to ſupport it, and take the rights which God gave to the
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> for the meaſure of all regall authority, which
if they were, all Kings would have equall power, but this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
varyes according to different Lawes, and is more or leſſe
according to ſeverall conſtitutions. That which is pleaded for
in this diſcourſe, as common to them and our Kings, is onely
<hi>jus regni,</hi> the right of Monarchy, not to be accomptable to any
inferiour juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not deny, a Kingdome may be ſo conſtituted (but
then it is no Monarchy) that upon a reall breach of ſuch or ſuch
conditions, named in the compact, and a forfeiture being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
the ſword of Juſtice may be taken up by ſome Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
appointed by law, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> amongſt the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi>
or by the people, as at <hi>Rome</hi> when the laſt appeale did
legally lye unto them, (for it did not alwayes, as when a Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
was created, he was the whole people for ſix moneths, and
though the time of his reigne was limited, his power was not
bounded, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, accomptable to none for what
he did in his regency, no, not when a private man again: and ſo
under the Emperours, as appeares by the <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> quoted by
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian,</hi> which transferred all the peoples power upon him,
<hi>(L. quod. D. de conſtit. prin.)</hi> A miſtake upon this hath ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſo many of the Kings Subjects into Rebellion. For becauſe
it is made appeare a State may be ſo eſtabliſhed, and they are
induced to beleeve, it is more reaſonable it ſhould be ſo eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
upon theſe premiſes they conclude moſt inconſequently,
that our State is ſo eſtabliſhed, and in the ſtrength of this fight
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52023:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt His Majeſtie, and did their beſt to kill Him, contrary to
Gods ordinance, applyed to our civill conſtitutions, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to their owne oath, in which they ſwore to be loyall in
reference to His Perſon, and that they would defend His life
with their utmoſt power.</p>
               <p>That a Kingdome may be ſo eſtabliſhed, a conſidering man
will not gainſay. If the State of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould call their Duke
King, this new name would not convey any new power into
him. Election or ſucceſſion cannot rule the caſe; for an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Kingdome may be conferred abſolutely, as will appeare in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and a ſucceſſive may be ſubject to forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if this be expreſt in the Covenant. For ſucceſſion is not a
new title to more right, but a legall continuance of what was
firſt gotten.</p>
               <p>2. That it is more reaſonable ſo to eſtabliſh a Kingdome,
that the Prince ſhall be accomptable to a higher power, either
placed in ſome Magiſtrates, or in the people, (and then by the
way it is not a Monarchy, but either an Ariſtocracy or a popular
State) though this be very falſe, yet if it were true, it cannot
juſtifie this warre now undertaken as things are ordered in this
Land, againſt the King. Becauſe Policy is no diſpenſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
obſerving knowne Lawes, and we may not deſtroy our
Governours out of reaſon of State; <hi>Machiavell</hi> muſt not give
Law to the Goſpell. If we might challenge ſuch liberty, there
were not ſuch a thing as Juſtice, our oaths would be of no force
againſt Intereſt; profit ſhould be the meaſure of our actions,
and we muſt conclude all right what ever was advantageous.
Since then not ſuch perſons as they could better fancy, but thoſe
onely whom the Law hath conſided in, and enabled to that
end, can put Armes into the hands of the people, it concernes
every man, as much as his ſoule is worth (for that will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be loſt in thoſe great ſinnes of Rebellion, Perjury, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
ſadly to examine whether to fight againſt the King, be not
to reſiſt the Supreame Power, to which God hath threatned
damnation.</p>
               <p>Every State hath a ſupereminent dominion or paramount in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
over all particular men, and what belongs to them, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52023:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conſequently hath full power to reſtraine the licence of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the preſervation of order and publique tranquillity.
That it ſhould lay ſuch an obligation upon all Subjects,<note place="margin">Non-reſiſtance to the ſupreame power, eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation of order.</note> there is
evident reaſon, becauſe what the ſupreame power, that is the
State (in order to thoſe things wherein ſupremacy conſiſts)
does, is truly the act of all, and none can have juſt cauſe of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
for diſlike of what they themſelves doe; and moreover
neceſſity inforces it. Becauſe without this the eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a State were deſtroyed, which is, Order. For this cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if firſt and laſt be confounded, and the Citie is diſſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a multitude, and that which ſhould be one body, becomes ſo
many independent men.</p>
               <p>The benefits which are conveyed to us by men in authority,
are deſcribed by <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.. 2. 2. and he calls them <hi>the leading
of a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> It is not
imaginable how they ſhould be enabled to compaſſe this end,
except ſome ſentence be ſupreame, from which it ſhall not be
lawfull to appeale; and conſequently except that power which
Law armes, and which lookes to the execution of what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
be not to be reſiſted. For if it ſhould be indulged to us
to change our Adverſary, and fall out with the Judge, and as oft
as we thinke we ſuffer wrong by his determination, to take the
freedome of righting our ſelves, upon this ground, that <hi>his duty
is to give righteous judgement, and therefore not ſatisfying that
truſt, he is no longer a Judge, then juſt; his ſentence ought not to
be ſubmitted to, for we are not bound to be obedient to his will, but
law; if he endeavour to put it in execution by himſelfe or his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Officers; though we kill him, it is no fault, becauſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
was offered onely to his perſon, not to his authority, which
was none in this caſe, becauſe he judged againſt Law, and that
gives not power to its owne overthrow;</hi> it is evident this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
makes our ſtrifes and debates endleſſe, all our Lawes would
be writ in bloud; it breakes in ſunder all the bonds with which
the goodly frame of government is knit together, and robbes us
of our peace under Anarchy and confuſion. Out of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the wiſedome of all States hath thought it fit to ſecure
the perſon or perſons in whom the ſupreame power is ſeated,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52023:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the ſtricteſt Lawes, and moſt ſevere puniſhment, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conſiſt with a liberty of reſiſtance, to the indangering his or
their lives. By the Civill Law, a Souldier was caſhiered, not
if he did ſtrike againe, but if he onely kept off ſome ſtrokes, and
held the rod of a Centurion; but if he broke it willingly, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the leaſt violence, he was ſacrificed to the <hi>Roman</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and expiated his offence by death. Certainly the people
would have nouriſhed in their breaſts a greater reverence, and
more awfull reſpects towards Majeſtie, if they had not beene ill
catechized and taught, that <hi>Dei miniſter eſt nobis in bonum,</hi> He
is the Miniſter of God, might be conſtrued, the Peoples ſervant;

God himſelfe perfects it. If it had ſtayed there, if God had not
pleaſed to adde to, and finiſh it, yet it had beene moſt true, that
no reſiſtance were lawfull; and evidently falſe, that he were
<hi>univerſis minor,</hi> becauſe he that hath ſupreame, that is, all their

But the obligation of not reſiſting is infinitely more weighty, if

we conſider him not onely as repreſenting the people, but as
repreſenting God himſelfe.<note place="margin">The King Gods repreſentative, aſwell as the peoples.</note> He hath given to him a power of

               <p>I have done with my proofes out of the Old Teſtament, and

               <p>And ſecondly it is evidenced, that the ſame power which the

and he declares his pleaſure ſo to doe, and therefore we muſt
chooſe the leaſt evill, which is, not to reſiſt, and by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſave our goods or bodies, to looſe our ſoules. Certainly
if we were as truly religious as we would be thought to be, we

excuſe our uncharitableneſſe, then our reſiſtance. But what if
their cruelty extend to the fartheſt, and endeavour to take away
our lives wrongfully?</p>
               <p>Theſe are juſtly deare to men, and much is done to draw out
a few yeares, (notwithſtanding our comforts are interwoven
with ſorrowes, our feares are oftentimes above our hopes, moſt
of our dayes are cloudy, and over-caſt with melancholyes, and
the diſcontents ariſing from our wants (which are as vaſt and
unbounded as our deſires to have) are much greater then the
narrow pleaſures of enjoyment, which is confined to a few
things, the ſtroaking of fortune being not ſo delightfull, as her

upon eternall life? how highly ought we to prize thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
joyes, which ſtill quicken, and ſtill ſatisfie the appetite,
and what ſhould we not ſuffer, rather then forfeit theſe? This
is the preſent caſe, He that by reſiſting ſaves his life, (a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

to their deſtruction, and they gave themſelves up to the

failing in this duty by reſiſting the Magiſtrate in defence

and therefore informes us largely with the full extent of
Chriſtian patience. I will firſt lay downe the grounds for which
our Saviour reprehended him, and I deſire they may be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pondered by ſuch as are more inexcuſably faultie, and then
I ſhall take his precepts into conſideration. Much may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
in <hi>Peters</hi> juſtification, and yet all will not excuſe him,
<hi>Put up thy ſword againe into his place,</hi> ſayes Chriſt; if he do not,
he threatens the puniſhment of murder to him, <hi>all they that take
the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword, Matth.</hi> 26. 52. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
them ſadly to apply, who pretend reſiſtance, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
invaders, and therefore cannot make ſo faire a plea. Firſt,
it was a ſodaine and unexpected aſſault, no means of eſcape did
appeare. Secondly, their violence armed with Swords and
with Staves as againſt a thiefe, did evidently aime at the life of
his Maſter; and he might not without reaſon ſuſpect his owne
in danger. Thirdly, he kept the lawes of that which is called
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52023:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>inculpata tutela,</hi> innocent defence; he did it in the inſtant, not
after deliberation, when he might have thought of other
wayes of ſafetie, and he had no advantage of Weapon, and he
did not kill outright, but only wounded a ſervant. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this he is rebuked by Chriſt, who makes ſatisfaction
for his offence by a miracle. And the ſenſe of this correction
made ſo deep an impreſſion, that he after warned others of
their duty, when they ſuffer in the like perſecution. <hi>Let none of
you ſuffer as a murderer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian,
let him not be aſhamed; but let him glorifie God on this behalfe.
For the time is come, that judgment muſt begin at the houſe of
God. Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God,
commit the keeping of their ſoules to him in well doing, as unto a
faithfull creator, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. Though this might ſerve turne, yet
he ſpeakes more home in another place, <hi>Submit your ſelves to
every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the
King as ſupreame, or unto Governours, as unto them that are
ſent by him for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of
them that doe well. For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing,
you may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men. As free, and
not uſing your liberty for a cloake of maliciouſneſſe, but as the
ſervants of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Feare God, honour the King. Servants
be ſubject to your Maſters with all feare, not only to the good

a man for conſcience towards God, indure griefe, ſuffering
wrongfully. For even hereto were you called. Becauſe Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

and though <hi>vires non deeſſent,</hi> wee were ſure to make good our

to injuries alſo, and to be obedient as to <hi>good and gentle</hi> maſters,

ſo likewiſe to the <hi>froward,</hi> to <hi>bad</hi> as well as <hi>good</hi> Kings, their
failing of their duty, not licenſing us not to performe ours, nor
diſpenſing with our loyalty. This is evident, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
annexed equally inforce this duty in Subjects as in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Though liberty be our birthright, yet it muſt not be
made the cloake of ſin, it takes not off thoſe bonds with which
God hath tyed up our hands from fighting againſt the ſupream
power. No lifting up private ſwords againſt the ſword of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ours againſt Gods weapon, <hi>Deus reſiſtet,</hi> wee ſhall have

               <p>It is well worth our obſervation, that though the Apoſtles
maine worke was heaven, yet they are very ſollicitous to ſettle
our quiet upon earth, by enforcing obedience unto govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> delivers the mind of God moſt fully, moſt
plainely. He could not have expreſſed the duty of Subjects
more punctually, if he had lived in theſe laſt and worſt times,
wherein his doctrine ſeemes a kind of tame folly; as once much
learning, now much Religion hath made him mad. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

thinke it unreaſonable, to be bound to ſubmit to certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
evills, out of hopes of future good, and to be abuſed by bad
Magiſtrates, upon expectation to be righted hereafter; &amp; chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
waxeth cold, it muſt no longer be ranked amongſt Chriſtian
duties to preferre publique good to private intereſt, the peace
of the Church, and tranquillity of the State to our owne profit
or ſafety. No, <hi>we muſt ſtand faſt in the libertie, wherewith Chriſt
hath made us free.</hi> We are not ſo indiſcreet to ſubmit to any
triall by law, becauſe we may meet with corrupt Judges; <hi>patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinium
peccati, multitudo peccantium,</hi> our number ought to
make us ſafer then innocence can them; it is madneſſe to be
hanged, when we are more then thoſe that ſhould hang us; we
may call our ſelves the commonwealth (for this is ſome where,
and the leſſer part hath leſſe reaſon to challenge it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
and then <hi>Populi ſalus, Suprema lex,</hi> what ever condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to our ſafety, becomes law to the Kingdome. If any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and ill affected perſons object the breach of knowne lawes
by us, we muſt tell them they are abrogated by equity, becauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52023:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if they ſhould ſtand in force, they would deſtroy us. The truth
is, theſe men antedate that prophecy of Chriſt (as they have
done many beſides) <hi>He ſhall put downe all rule, and all authority,
and power.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24.</p>
               <p>This is clearely done by their practiſe, Kings are diſhonored
in the feare of God, and I neede not ſay <hi>quid verba audio, cum
facta videam,</hi> for their profeſt principles maintaine it. If they
are not of the true religion, that is, make not the peoples opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Creed, or if they do not governe to the advantage of
the Saints, that is, joyne not with them in thoſe deſignes which
they chriſten <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and <hi>the great worke,</hi> the <hi>pious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
then becauſe they are no longer <hi>Dei miniſtri in bonum,</hi>

beene induced to fight againſt God, and periſhed in their ſin,

If I muſt direct my ſpeech as unto cowards (for you have
no excuſe for diſloyalty, but your feares) conſider with your
ſelves, how God hath bleſſed his ſervant with three potent
and ſucceſſefull Armies (all of them raiſed with ſuch diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
as they clearly ſpeake an immediate providence giving
teſtimony to the ſincerity of his many ſacred proteſtations)
beſide many hopefull Seminaries in divers Countries, and
thouſands of gallant Gentlemen, and brave ſpirits in other
Shires, now unfortunately ſituated <hi>(O triſti damnata loco)</hi> who
wait for an oportunity to revenge their tame ſuffering hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52023:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the unworthy uſage from fellow Subjects. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this you could unreaſonably flatter your ſelves with
being the ſtronger ſide, yet you have juſter and greater feares
elſewhere, which ought to give Law to your cowardiſe, which
hath betrayed your alleagiance. For what would it profit you,
if you ſhould ſave your houſes from being plunder'd (though
this is the moſt probable way to hazard your eſtates, which are
forfeited to the King, cannot be eſcheated to them) and looſe
your ſoules, for which the whole world is but a baſe price?
There is evident danger in fighting againſt the King, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
threatens certaine deſtruction becauſe you fight againſt
your owne conſciences.</p>
               <p>Their ſeverall exceptions and corrupt gloſſes by which they
endeavour to avoyd this plaine obligation of non reſiſtance, I

               <p>The practiſe of primitive chriſtians is a faithfull commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon theſe texts.<note place="margin">The duty not to reſiſt proved further by the practiſe of the more innocent ages of the Church.</note> And certainly their authority, (who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to their owne diſadvantage, teaching ſubmiſſion though to
tyrants, under which they cheerefully ſuffered according to
Chriſts example) ought to prevaile with us above any moderne
writers, who have broached a doctrine (very ſeaſonable for
ſome places and occaſions, but unknowne to thoſe innocent
times, when Chriſtianity thrived upon ſuffering, and gained as
much by patience, as it is likely to looſe by ſtubbornneſſe) that
it <hi>is lawfull for inferior Magiſtrates,</hi> ſay ſome, <hi>(and this from the
fundamentalls of government;) for the people,</hi> others, tells us,
<hi>(and this from the law of nature)</hi> to <hi>right themſelves by force, if
the ſupreme Magiſtrate deny to do it, and ſo faile of that truſt,
which was committed to him for the good of others.</hi> Theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
lately taken up open a faire way for advancement of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends, by diſturbance of publique peace, either upon reall

which ſhall never be wanting, whilſt there are ambitious men
who want preferment, and deſire to have what others are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of, and make it a reaſonable cauſe, to endeavour innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe they may be bettered by the change. In what an
unhappy State do we live, if ſuch a number (upon pretence we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52023:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not ſo well governed as we might be, that is, they have not
ſo great a ſhare in the government, as they could wiſh for, and
ſince the greater part can never be ſatisfied, we cannot hope for
peace and quiet) ſhall be enabled to force the King to recede
from lawes and in the roome of thoſe knowne and ſtanding
rules, to give us uncertaine temporary ordinances.</p>
               <p>The Emperours were for the moſt part very bad, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the Chriſtians they were hard maſters. Though the
Romans counted it the higheſt gallantry, to ſhake off the yoke
when it galled them, and did oft rebell in the cauſe of liberty;
(and it is a ſad thing that this pagan bravery ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the tameneſſe which Chriſt injoyned to his followers;
<hi>of all good actions the murder of a tyrant is moſt commendable,</hi>
ſayes one. Euſeb. Philad. dial. 2. And <hi>Buchanan</hi> thinkes it a
defect in policy, that <hi>rewards are not allotted for ſuch meritorious
deeds)</hi> yet the Chriſtians could never be tempted by their
greateſt ſufferings to joyne in any conſpiracy. <hi>Tertullian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
their innocency, and he is to be looked upon in this caſe,
not as a ſingle witneſſe, but as one that wrote in the name of all;
his Apologetique is the ſence of the whole Church. We may
be confident of the truth, becauſe it was a matter of fact, and
we have no reaſon to ſuſpect he could be ſo vainly impudent as
to preſent that in their juſtification, which muſt be evidently
convinced of falſehood. He makes a bold challenge, and deſires
them to produce if they can one example of any Chriſtian tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part with rebells. Such as <hi>Caſſius, Niger, Albinus, Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Aelius Letus,</hi> the <hi>Pretorian ſouldiers</hi> (who murdered <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax)
Stephanus,</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> were. It is manifeſt theſe
were not traitours out of wantonneſſe, there were juſt grounds
for heavy complaints under <hi>Domitian, Commodus</hi> and <hi>Septimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Severus,</hi> all bloudy tyrants. Yet the Chriſtians were better
catechiſed, then to thinke reſiſtance lawfull, when they were
oppreſſed by thoſe whoſe duty it was to have protected them.
Their unanimous confeſſion is, <hi>nos judicium Dei ſuſpicimus in
imperatoribus, qui gentibus illos praefecit.</hi> I ſhall give you the
ſenſe of it at large. We kiſſe the hands which wound us;
though they have not any cauſe to doe ſuch things, yet there is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52023:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
too much cauſe why we ſhould ſuffer them, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our ſinns towards God, and he may puniſh them in what
way he thinkes fit. We cannot deny, but we have deſerved as
great afflictions, and ſhall we, who are guilty be ſtubborne,
when patience is required, though we were moſt innocent?
The example of Chriſt is made our law, and in him no ſin was
found. We cannot ſuffer more, nor boaſt leſſe demerit. If we
did ſeriousſly conſider it, we could not hate the worſt gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
for we have no reaſon to be angry, becauſe they do things
to our advantage, and certaine it is, if we ſubmit with patience,
their ſins further our ſalvation, their faults encreaſe our glory.
What pitty is it, they ſhould goe to Hell, for that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
us a higher place in heaven? Nay what uncharitableneſſe
is it in us, to cut them off in their ſin, and ſo ſend them thither?
And it is a ſad meditation, to think that we ſhall follow; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we could not indure their company here, we take a courſe
to live together eternally miſerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> inforces this meekneſſe with excellent reaſon. <hi>God</hi>
(ſaith he to <hi>Demetrian) is the revenger of his injur'd ſervants:</hi>
in which this argument is implyed, Vengeance belongs unto the
Lord, and except we can produce his Commiſſion, our private
juſtice will damne us; <hi>animam in vulnere,</hi> in our enemies
wounds our ſoules will bleed to death: 'tis madneſſe to ſtrike,
when we are certaine the blow will recoyle to our eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Therefore the Apoſtle commands, as we wiſh well
to our ſelves, to <hi>recompence to no man evill for evill: Rom.</hi> 12. 17.
Selfe-love is the motive why we ſhould not hurt others. He
exhorts by the naturall affection which is due to our ſelves, not
to <hi>avenge our ſelves,</hi>

Upon theſe conſiderations God hath made revenge unlawfull,
and beſide this obligation of divine precept, our hands are tyed
up as ſtrongly as faith of promiſe can do it. This Covenant knits
ſociety, and cements the civill body. Though we do not onely
fancy grievances (as the world is full of ſuch miſtakes) though
we are really injured, yet it becomes injuſtice to right our
ſelves. All the accompt we can give at Gods Tribunall, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, we did not ſinne firſt. And this plea will afford miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
comfort to be damn'd after another. That none might be
tempted to ſtrike, becauſe others hands are bound up from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the blow, God hath appointed a middle way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
men from doing evill, for feare of ſuffering it in as high a
degree. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes true, <hi>diſciplinae intereſt, injuriam
vindicari. Metu enim ultionis omnis iniquitas refraenatur.</hi> The
fountaine of our actions is the opinion we have of the good or
bad, we ſhall receive by them; if they appeare certainly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that we ſhall ſuffer by ſo doing, we moſt commonly
forbeare, I doe not ſay alwayes, becauſe the will may thwart
the underſtanding, elſe it were not free, and experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that ſometimes a leſſe good preſent, doth overweigh a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
though certaine greater evill. God will judge our cauſe,
and revenge us upon wrong doers; but he performes this not
immediately, but by his Magiſtrates. He delegates his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proclaimes their Commiſſion in
theſe words, <hi>There is no power but of God. Quicquid per offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arios
facit, per ſe facere videtur,</hi> what they doe are legally his
acts, we have no right to reverſe them by a ſtrong hand. If an
inferiour Magiſtrate gives falſe judgement, God grants a liberty
of appeale to him in a higher Magiſtrate, if he confirme the
former unjuſt ſentence, it is lawfull to proceed by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,
till we come to the higheſt; but then becauſe God hath
appointed a peaceable end of controverſies, we muſt ſit downe
with the preſent loſſe, being fully aſſured God will judge this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52023:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Judge; we ſhall have another day of hearing in Heaven, and all
damages ſhall be amply repaid. If we did beleeve this, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
diviſions would ceaſe, that is, if we were truely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
we would not doe as we have done, we could not reſiſt
the higheſt power. I have warrant to ſay it, <hi>Here is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and faith of the Saints: Rev.</hi> 13. 10. they beleeved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſuffer'd.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuch conſiderations <hi>Cyprian</hi> grounds the <hi>duty,</hi> and
ſhewes the <hi>practice</hi> of the Primitive Chriſtians was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant.
<hi>Inde eſt quòd nemo noſtrum, quando apprehenditur, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctatur:
nec ſe adverſus injuſtam violentiam veſtram, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
nimius &amp; copioſus noſter ſit populus, ulciſcitur.</hi> For this
cauſe not any one of us doth make reſiſtance when you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him, nor revenge your unjuſt violence: <hi>Patientes facit
de ſecuturâ ultione ſecuritas.</hi> God is able to reward our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and to requite all our ſufferings. If we tooke delight in
the miſery of our perſecutors, we might be abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.
But alas we pitty them, and grieve more for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
condition, then our owne torments. God will avenge
our innocent bloud more ſeverely, then any good man can wiſh
for. <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſes the ſame in his eloquent manner. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
idoneus patientiae ſequeſter Deus eſt.</hi> Our goods are not taken
away, they are ſequeſtred for our benefit, and intruſted in ſafe
hands, God keepes them for our uſe and will returne them with
ample increaſe. <hi>Si injuriam depoſueris penes eum, ultor eſt,</hi> if you
will not fight, he will undertake your quarrell, and you need not
doubt but your enemies will be ſoundly worſted; <hi>Si dolorem, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus
eſt,</hi> your wounds ſhall ſave you, <hi>Si mortem, reſuſcitator eſt,</hi>
if you fall a Martyr, you ſhall riſe a Saint. <hi>Quantum patientiae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,
ut Deum habeat debitorem?</hi> what cannot our ſufferings doe?
they make even God our debtor; he owes us heaven for our
ſelves, and he owes us Hell for our enemies, but we breath out
our ſoules in prayer, that he may be intreated not to pay this.</p>
               <p>The Example of the <hi>Thebane</hi> Legion commands our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the like cauſe. It is one of the nobleſt paſſages in all the
eccleſiaſticall ſtory, wherein Chriſtianity did ſhine forth in its
full luſtre, and it affords plentifull light for our direction. This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52023:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
band conſiſted of almoſt 7000 men, all Chriſtians. when the
Emperour <hi>Maximian</hi> commands the whole Army to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to falſe Gods, they remove their quarters, that they might
avoid if it were poſſible this occaſion of diſcontenting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
He ſummons them to performe their parts in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh
worſhip. They are forced to returne an humble deniall,
and their reſolution not to diſobey God, for whoſe ſake they
had ever beene and would continue faithfull ſervants to him.
The Emperour unſatisfied with this anſwer, puts them to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimation;
They ſubmit with much cheerefulneſſe, and dy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their murderer. After this ſad ſpectacle his commands
are renewed, but prevaile nothing upon the remainder. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they alſo are butchered without the leaſt reſiſtance; There
was no delay in their death, except from the wearineſſe of the
executioners. This was truly to confeſſe him, who was led as a
ſheepe to the ſlaughter, and like a lambe opened not his mouth,
and they a flocke of his fold, were quietly devoured by rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolves. The Commander of this Regiment, <hi>Maurice</hi>
could not containe his joy, when he had ſeene the firſt decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gallantly ſuffered. How fearefull was I, ſayes he to his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
ſouldiers, (for armed men may be tempted to defend
themſelves) leſt any of them upon colour of juſt reſiſtance for
ſelfe preſervation in an innocent cauſe, ſhould have ſtrugled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this bleſſed ſlaughter. I was watchfull, and had Chriſts
example in readineſſe, who commanded his diſciple to put his
ſword into his ſcabberd. <hi>Salus veſtra non periclitabitur, niſi
veſtris armis,</hi> if you uſe not your weapons, I have Gods owne
warrant for your ſafety.</p>
               <p>Deſpaire it ſelfe could not conquer one ſingle patience, which
yet creates valour in cowards, and makes them more couragious
in ſuch extremities, becauſe they are fearefull; Since they are
likely to endeavour moſt to preſerve life; who are moſt terrified
with death.</p>
               <p>It would be more weariſome to me, then delightfull, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Reader, to inlarge my proofes by that plenty of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
which offer themſelves in the ancient Fathers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Councels. The truth is, the labour is needleſſe, their practiſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52023:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is ſo evident, that the greateſt friends to Rebellion, will not
betray ſo much ignorance as to deny it. They are forced to
grant that they doe ſuch things, as thoſe great lights of the
Church, thoſe holy men, though infinitely more oppreſſed then
they can pretend to, durſt not venture on. Thus farre we both
agree. But why durſt not? Here they ſhew themſelves; not
becauſe to reſiſt Tyrants would have beene a wicked, but a
vaine attempt; <hi>vires deerant,</hi> they were not able to go through
with a Rebellion; what the Heathens admired as <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
goodneſſe</hi> (many of them being converted by this religious
confidence, reaſonably concluding, men that approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very prudent in all other matters,<note place="margin">Not want of ſtrength the cauſe of their patience.</note> could not be guilty of
ſuch madneſſe as to die thus, unleſſe they had good hopes to be
recompenced in another life) theſe fomenters of ſtrife call
<hi>weakeneſſe,</hi> to the unſpeakable ſcandall of ſuch as have a true
ſenſe of godlineſſe. It is an inſufferable blemiſh to their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and ſtaines the pretious memory of thoſe bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
If this were indeed true, that they wanted not <hi>will,</hi> but
<hi>power</hi> to deſtroy, we can hardly blame their perſecutors, who
thought it wiſedome to prevent the blow by ſtriking firſt: it
ſeemed but killing the Cockatrice in the egge; they had ſmall
encouragement to cheriſh frozen Serpents in their boſome, who
when they had recovered warmth and ſtrength, would dart
their poyſonous ſting at their preſervers. Certainely they had
an extraordinary confidence they ſhould prevaile, elſe they
would never ſo openly have diſcovered ſuch principles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
States to provide better for their ſecurity hereafter, by
utter diſabling them to do any hurt. Theſe men cry out againſt
<hi>Popery,</hi> and yet profeſſe what all <hi>good Proteſtants</hi> eſteeme the
moſt malignant part of <hi>Jeſuitiſme.</hi> If this evaſion will not
hold, they know not what to ſay for themſelves, and it may
clearely be convinced of falſhood. For this very objection is
made by the Ancients, and anſwered to our hands by themſelves.
So carefull were they that poſterity might not miſtake their
<hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and thinke it nothing elſe but an <hi>impotency</hi> to do evill.
The Fathers ſpeeches, which witneſſe ſufficient ſtrength, if reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had not tyed their hands, cannot be imputed to any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52023:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or lying to gaine reputation to their ſufferings (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Goodwin</hi> inſinuates in his Anticaval. and we ſhall anon take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it) our enemies would be extreamely glad to ſee their
owne art thus credited. But we have no reaſon to conceive
them ſo impudent, and we may be certaine, they were not ſo
mad, as to face downe the Emperour, and their other potent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
(who would make great advantage of their ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
untruths) by affirming what they muſt evidently diſcerne
falſe, and could not chooſe but ſee the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith expreſſely, <hi>Quamvis nimius &amp; copioſus noſter ſit
populus,</hi> though we have competent forces more then enough
to do the buſineſſe, yet we wreſtle not with our oppreſſors &amp;c.
The <hi>Theban Legion</hi> was in a poſture of reſiſtance, but they durſt
not lift up thoſe hands into which the Emperour had put wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
againſt his perſonall commands, though moſt unjuſt,
moſt bloody. ſix thouſand ſix hundred, and ſixty ſix men of
ſuch extraordinary valour, as did not entertaine the leaſt feare
of death might probably have conquered (and this cruelty
might have increaſed their party by the defection of male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents)
but they muſt certainely have made ſome ſport for their
lives, they could not have wanted that comfort, which to ſome
taſts is beyond the pleaſure of life, to die revenged. Beſides
had not the Emperour and his under princes known them true
Chriſtians, and beene acquainted with the tameneſſe of that
profeſſion, towards the higheſt power, he would never have
hazarded a rebellion by making ſo conſiderable an army deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this with Tertullian, who argues very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely,
after he had ſpoken to this ſence; we are ſo numerous
you can hardly ſee one another for Chriſtians, <hi>cui, inquit, bello
non idonei, non prompti fuiſſemus, etiam impares copiis, qui tam
libenter trucidamur?</hi> Though we had not the advantage of
number, Which yet you perceive we have, <hi>numeri damnum
virtus penſaret,</hi> courage would ſupply this defect, and though
fewer, ſince we contemne our owne lives, we might be maſters
of yours. We could undoe you, not if we ſhould rebell, but if
we would be idle; we do not fright you ſo much, as to deſire
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52023:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, to fancy us fighting againſt you, you were loſt if we did
not fight for you. What would become of you, if we ſhould
turne <hi>Separatiſts? Si tanta vis hominum,</hi> if ſuch multitudes as
we are ſhould breake out from amongſt you into any corner of
the world, your Empire would ſinke for want of ſtrength to
ſupport it. Your Cities would ſeeme deſerts without us &amp;c.
in that thin remainder you would have many enemies, though
but few men. Even now they would rebell, if they were not
awed <hi>multitudine Chriſtianorum, paene omnium civium,</hi> by thoſe
multitudes of us, who are of ſome ranke, almoſt all of us citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and almoſt all the citizens are of us. Our example invites
ſome to obedience, others feare our readineſſe to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to reduce them to due ſubjection. <hi>In Apologetico.</hi> I may
adde his other ſpeech in the ſame place, <hi>veſtra omnia implevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
we have filled your Cities, nay <hi>caſtra ipſa,</hi> your very
camps would be empty without us Chriſtians. It is not poſſible
to bring in more expreſſe, more clear teſtimonies in any matter,
it is too probable, ſuch as have made a ſearch, are blinded with
intereſt, and ſhut their eyes that they may not ſee this truth. I
know not how to excuſe <hi>Bellarmine, Alane, Ficlerus, Siman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,
Buchanan, Hottoman, Knox, Brutus,</hi> for theſe were ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
and therefore not ſo likely to be deceived themſelves in
ſuch an eaſie truth, as upon deſigne to deceive others. But I
have a more charitable opinion of moſt of thoſe men, with
whom we have to deale, though ſome have diſcovered plenty
of malice, yet they are very few, of whom we can ſay, <hi>ad ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendam
rempublicam ſobrii acceſſerunt.</hi> Some are <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and
miſtake their owne fancy for the Spirit, and the greater part do

ſupreme power in any State (let it be where it will, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
it muſt be, for elſe it were an Anarchy, and no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
ought not to be reſiſted. This makes rebellion ſin, as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
divine and humane lawes. In the next place, for the
perfect direction of conſcience,<note place="margin">Moſt neceſſary to know the ſubject of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</note> wee muſt examine, in whom
the ſupreme power is placed; a miſtake in this is as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as an errour in the former. For as zeale, which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to knowledge, is impiety; for though it have the heat,
it hath not the light, which is required to true devotion; ſo
the moſt ſcrupulous obedience is but humble rebellion, if it be
miſplaced, and yielded to fellow Subjects againſt him who
hath <hi>jus regnandi,</hi> the right to command them. Thus in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracy
to aide one man againſt the Senate, is Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the State, and in a Monarchy (becauſe the conſtitution
is different, and places the ſupreme power in one) to aide the
Senate (of which that one is the head, and oppoſed to him,
they are but a liveleſſe trunk in order to thoſe things to which
his influence is neceſſary, <hi>Forteſcue</hi> warrants the expreſſion,
<hi>ſine capite communitas non corporatur)</hi> againſt the Monarch and
ſupreame Ruler, is rebellion and treaſon againſt the State. The
Aſſumption therefore ſhall be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King of</hi> ENGLAND <hi>hath this ſupreame power.]</hi> when
this is proved, the conſcience muſt take law from this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inference, therefore it is unlawfull for Subjects to hold up
armes againſt the King of <hi>England:</hi> Becauſe as it is an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in ſpeculation, ſo it is ſinne in practice to deny the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
there they offend againſt Logique, here againſt Religion
alſo. For whatſoever is not of faith, that is, not of judgment,
whatſoever wee doe againſt our owne reaſon, and the light of
conſcience, is tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>The matter of this diſcourſe is of high concernment. For as
things now ſtand, on it hang Heaven or Hell, our ſalvation or
eternall damnation. If the King be the higheſt power, you are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52023:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bound to ſubmit to him, but if you have new Soveraignes, if
your fellow Subjects are become the Lords anoynted, there may
be ſome colour of juſtification. Except this be proved, you are
altogether inexcuſable, as appeares in the laſt Section, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will behoove you to hearken to <hi>Solomons</hi> advice; <hi>My
ſonne feare thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with
them that are given to change. For their calamity ſhall riſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely,

Crowne of this Realme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So helpe me God and by the Contents of this Booke.]</hi> It hath
beene replyed, That <hi>this Oath is taken in oppoſition to the Pope,
to exclude the Supremacy uſurped by him for many yeares.</hi> They
ſpeake truth, but not all the truth; for there are two parts in it.
One negative, by which wee profeſſe, that not any forraigne
State, or Potentate, nor the Pope hath this power. The other
poſitive, by which the Subject of this power is ſpecified. <hi>The
Kings Highneſſe is the onely ſupreame Governour of this Realme,</hi>
as in all Spirituall things, and cauſes, ſo likewiſe Temporall.
Both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill ſupremacy are here aſſerted to be
in the King. It was not thought ſufficient to tell who was not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52023:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Supreme, but they declare alſo who was. When we had truly
ſworne the Pope out of this Kingdome, what neceſſity was
there to make the people perjur'd? for certainely they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare
themſelves, who ſolemnely teſtifie and declare in their
conſcience, That <hi>the Kings highneſſe is the onely ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi>
if the meaning of thoſe words be onely this, that the
Pope is not. It concernes us as highly as our Soules are worth,
<hi>reddere juramentum domino,</hi> to performe unto the Lord our
Oath, and not to lift up thoſe hands againſt the King, which
were layd upon the holy Goſpell, in witneſſe of our ſubmiſſion
to him <hi>as the onely ſupreme Governour.</hi> What deſperate malice
is it to expoſe our Soules to every Musket ſhot? if wee fall, we
periſh eternally. This ſad contemplation, that wee ſtand on
the very brinke of Hell, ready to be turned into the Lake of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
woes, by every ſword, every bullet, will ſmite our
hearts, and make our armes feeble in the day of battaile; what
confuſion &amp; amazement and horrour of conſcience muſt needs
ſeize upon all conſidering men? Think upon the heinouſneſſe of
parricide, to murther a Father is a ſin greater then any one is
able to beare: But to ſpill the bloud of our Soveraigne (which
they have done, who fought againſt him, for it is murderin
Gods ſight; his goodneſſe in protecting his ſervant, doth not
excuſe their ſin in endeavouring to deſtroy their King) whom
God commands not to touch, and whoſe life we have ſworn <hi>to
defend with the utmoſt hazard of our owne,</hi> and we have deſired
the Lord to revenge it in our deſtruction, if we doe otherwiſe,
is of a much deeper dye. For the King is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father to all without a Metaphor: what ever power Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had <hi>over,</hi> and conſequently whatſoever honour as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this power, was due to them <hi>from</hi> their children, he hath
right to challenge the ſame of all. And though we ſhould joyne
together,<note place="margin">King hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall powers from conſent of the people.</note> and call our ſelves the Common-wealth, we can no
more lawfully diſ-reſpect, give law to, reſiſt upon hard uſage,
or ſay he is leſſe honourable then all we, then children by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may diſpenſe with their duty to their parents. It was our
owne act which united all particular paternall powers in Him,
and that theſe are truly transferred, and now really in Him is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52023:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very evident, becauſe elſe we ſhould be bound to obey our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
commands, before thoſe of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For divine precept
ſtands in full force, <hi>Honour thy Father, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore we
muſts confeſſe, <hi>tam pater nemo eſt in terris,</hi> he that begot us is
not ſo much our Father, as the King is. It may be fit to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
here, that the ſupreme power of a State, hath by our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
deeds and common agreement, as much right over, not
ſingle perſons onely, but the whole body, as every Father had
over not this or that child onely, but his whole family: and as
he cannot be ſaid, though <hi>major ſingulis natis,</hi> yet <hi>totâ prole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
ſo neither a King (if this power be placed in one, which is
eſſentiall to a Monarchy) <hi>minor univerſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though a Monarch hath greater right, and larger power,
then even all the people could beſtow upon him, for he hath
<hi>poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He hath power of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Gods grant.</note> and this Fathers have not now over
their children, over themſelves; it can only come from him
who hath dominion over his creatures, and therfore the people
muſt looke upon him, not only as their <hi>owne,</hi> but as <hi>Gods repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative;</hi>
yet to ſay nothing of this, and to deale liberally
with our adverſaries, by ſuppoſing (though I cannot grant)
their principles true, concerning the originall of power being
in the people, I can demonſtrably convince them, by moſt
plaine and evident deductions from their owne ſcheame.</p>
               <p>I tooke this method in my <hi>Anſwer to the Obſervations,</hi> that
by joyning iſſue upon their owne grounds, I might put a
quicker end to the debate. It would have required more time
to ſhew at large, <hi>The Kings power was from God</hi> (which was
proved in briefe, and there, as is this diſcourſe, it is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be reſtrained by His own or His Progenitors grants, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
enim Rex vim regni minuere)</hi> and ſo of much higher nature
then the contribution of popular Votes could raiſe it to; it was
aboundantly ſufficient, to prove that <hi>the people have not any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
power againſt the King.</hi> The former is built upon this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<hi>nemo dat, quod non habet;</hi> the power of the Magiſtrate was
not in the people conſidered ſeverally, and before civill ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in ſuch a State, as the <hi>Aborigenes</hi> are deſcribed by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt,
genus hominum agreſte, ſine legibus, ſine imperio, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52023:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
atque ſolutum, a multitude, not a nation, and certaine wild
routs, without Laws, without Empire, free to doe or ſuffer wrong,
and looſe from all poſitive obligations.</hi> Not any one having <hi>jus
gladii,</hi> a right to take away the life of man, it followes they
could not beſtow it upon another, for what is not, cannot be
alienated. And therefore the ſupreame Magiſtrate hath more
power then the whole people, and is <hi>vice Deus,</hi> Gods vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Let them take heed how they call <hi>Gods miniſter</hi> the <hi>peoples
Servant;</hi> God hath taken eſpeciall care the Magiſtrate ſhould
be honoured; and reſpect is due, as to his, not their creature.</p>
               <p>The latter, that the people have not any legall power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, is as firmely ſupported by another pillar, <hi>nemo
habet, quod dedit.</hi> Suppoſe the originall of power in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or as they love to ſpeake, ſuppoſe them the efficient cauſe
of power, which cannot be but by giving to one man in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
to a Senate in an Ariſtocracy, a right to uſe their divided
ſtrengths. <hi>Since therefore they cannot retaine, what they have
parted with, nor have what they gave away, he which hath all
their power (I may adde his owne particular beſides) muſt needs be
greater and more powerfull then they. The truth is, he is (in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and they are in an Ariſtocracy) the only fountaine of all
power and juſtice. Anſwer</hi> to the Obſervat, pag. 10. This is as
certaine, as that there are ſome governments beſides Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
for it is eſſentiall to them: what is that which makes
Anarchy, except this, that every man hath right to doe what
he will,<note place="margin">Demonſtration from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of formes of Regiment.</note> in reference to any nationall Law? The only meanes to
avoyd this confuſion, is to reſigne up this hurtfull liberty;
(which is very prudently done upon choice, but neceſſarily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conqueſt) if it be given to one, wee call that State, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
if to few, wee call it Optimacy; if to very many, who
rule by turnes and are elected by the people, wee call it Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.
There cannot be any other ground to difference the
formes of Regiment.</p>
               <p>Hence appeares the weakneſſe of thoſe diſcourſes, which
have no other ſtrength, then the impoſſibility, that the people
can make one greater and more powerfull then all they (which
is underſtood not of their naturall, (this cannot be paſt away
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52023:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to another) but politique ſtrength, that is the right of uſing
their power, this may be, and is parted with, (except the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
be a Democracy) becauſe <hi>Quicquid efficit tale, eſt
magis tale.</hi> The <hi>reply</hi> to the <hi>Anſwer to the Obſervations,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
my argument, concluding, <hi>if it were true that the people
had parted with their power, pag.</hi> 6. upon this the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole controverſie depends, and that it was rightly
ſtated by me, will evidently appeare, becauſe unleſſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have reſigned up their power, the Author can never ſhew
how this State is a Monarchy. It doth not alter the caſe, that
the King hath reſtrained himſelfe from the uſe of this power to
ſome purpoſes without their conſent, as for making new lawes
or raiſing money; for this limitation only makes ſuch acts ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
but doth not returne any power into them, whereby they
may be inabled to raiſe an Army, or to oppoſe the <hi>Militia</hi> of
the Kingdome againſt him, to compell him by ſtrong hand to
governe according to law. If the ſubject of this power be the
people, who may meet together and lawfully determine (for
though he reſolve all into the two Houſes, yet if he follow the
conſequences of his owne principle, he muſt goe thus high)
what they fancy conducing to their own ſafety, wee are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falne back into Anarchy. To avoid this confuſion, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
places it in their repreſentatives, but it will come to the
ſame thing by undenyable deductions from his owne grounds.
For the ſame arguments which are made againſt the King, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
conclude againſt the two Houſes; ſince <hi>Quicquid effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
tale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arguments brought againſt the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as much for the people againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> 
                  <hi>eſt magis tale,</hi> and that they are intruſted for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, may be equally applyed to them, and then King
and Lords and Commons are Voted away at the pleaſure of the
multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſumme of his Book is, that</hi> the people retain their power,
and therefore may make reſiſtance, in caſe he governe not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to law, and he is reſponſable for ſuch breaches; <hi>The proofe
is,</hi> He is intruſted for their good, and there is a mutuall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betweene King and people, and this violated by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
the compact.</p>
               <p>I have in this diſcourſe punctually examined theſe and what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52023:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
farther grounds of ſcruples I could finde in the replyer, as will
appeare more fully in the following Section. Being to anſwer
ſo many, I would not treſpaſſe upon the Readers patience by an
exact view of his particular miſtakes, which might have beene
confuted with great eaſe, but with no great advantage to the
cauſe, to which I have ſpoken more cloſely, and as fully as I
was able.</p>
               <p>I will diſcover to him one deſperate conſequence from his
principle, which it concernes him to bluſh and repent for.
<hi>There is a mutuall Covenant betweene King and People, and the
breach of it diſſolves the compact:</hi> if ſo, his Crowne is forfeited,
and he ceaſes to be King <hi>de jure</hi> upon ſuch violation, which he
is now charged with, (becauſe they could not have any colour
for taking up Armes, but upon this pretence.) Therefore the
plaine concluſion is, it is no want of duty in them, though they
depoſe him, for it is no injury to take away, what he can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
no right to; his claime was by vertue of compact, which
is diſſolved by his not ſtanding to conditions, and ſo the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
is unmade, the bonds of allegiance are broken aſunder.
The Houſes have laboured to cleare themſelves from this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doctrine, by telling us the depoſition of the ſecond <hi>Edward,</hi>
and <hi>Richard</hi> was not to be numbered amongſt the preſidents of
Parliament, and that no free Parliament ever attempted the like:
and yet a private man dares publiſh ſuch manifeſt Treaſon. I
am perſwaded that the Author, ſuppoſing a breach of covenant
of His Majeſties part, and then telling us ſuch a breach diſſolves
the compact, was not fully apprehenſive that this pernitious
principle unkings his Soveraigne. When he ſees his treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errour, he will finde that Logick ill managed is a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
weapon, then a ſword in the hands of mad men.</p>
               <p>To returne to further proofes of the Kings ſupremacy;<note place="margin">Kings ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy further proved.</note> That
which makes a State one, is the union of ſupreame power, and
this according as it is placed in one or more perſons, gives deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the forme: ſo that all thoſe Acts of Parliament
which confeſſe this a Monarchy, are ſo many ſolid teſtimonies
of the Kings ſupremacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Anſwer is,</hi> Though this be demonſtrably true in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52023:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Empire, yet it concludes not in a mixt Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I am very confident a miſtake of this <hi>mixt Monarchy</hi> hath
engaged many well-meaning men againſt the King, to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of our Lawes, which the ſimpler part are perſwaded
they fight for; <hi>Honeſtâ voluntate rebelles ſunt,</hi> there are ſome
who contribute their forces to deſtroy this Kingdome in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">The true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which is called a mixt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> and they are ſo farre deceived, as
to be made unhappy inſtruments to advance private intereſts
with publique hearts. And therefore it will be neceſſary to
diſcover their <hi>errour,</hi> by which their unfortunate Country hath
ſuffer'd as much, as by the <hi>ſaults</hi> of others.</p>
               <p>They have not any ſhadow of excuſe to countenance their
Rebellion from this diſtinction, unleſſe <hi>mixt Monarchy</hi> doe
ſignifie either that the people in their diffuſive body, or by their
repreſentatives have a greater, or at leaſt an equall power with
the King. The reaſon of which is, becauſe inferiours by the
acknowledgement of all, have not any juriſdiction over ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:
and equalls though they have not <hi>imperium,</hi> right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,
yet if injur'd and they require ſatisfaction, and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall
of it, attempt to compaſſe it by force, they are eſteemed
by the Law of Reaſon and Nations, <hi>juſt enemies:</hi> whereas Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
if they make warre upon their Soveraigne, though when
wronged, are worthily accompted Rebels. Firſt, the diffuſive
body of the people hath not greater, nay, not equall power
with the King, becauſe they have not any legall way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves. Our Lawes determine it Treaſon to enter into
any aſſociation, or raiſe a Warre without the Kings conſent, and
much more againſt his expreſſe commands. Secondly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
body hath not greater nor equall power with the
King. The ſame argument overthrowes their claime, for the
people cannot authorize them to doe, beyond what themſelves
were enabled to, therefore if actions of this nature were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
in the diffuſive body, they are ſo in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.<note place="margin">Repreſentative Body is not the People to all purpoſes.</note>
It may be not unfit to obſerve that the repreſentative
body is the <hi>people</hi> onely to ſome ends and purpoſes, whereto
they were intruſted by them according to Law, and therefore
no illegall ordinances, (ſuch as all thoſe are, which the King
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52023:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
denyes to ratifie) ought to be called the Acts of the people:
They are no more concerned in it, then if they ſhould take upon
them contrary to Law, to ſtampe and coyne money with the
inſcription of <hi>Senatis, populúſque Anglicanus,</hi> or to ſend Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
or denounce warre <hi>againſt,</hi> or enter into a League of
friendſhip <hi>with</hi> forreigne Princes, or beſtow the great offices
of State, or diſpoſe of Wardſhips, or take to themſelves a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to raiſe Armes without His Majeſties conſent. Againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they repreſent the people but to ſome purpoſes onely,
though their principles were firme, (as they are extreamely
weake) that the King is leſſe then His Subjects <hi>conjunctim,</hi> and
that they collectively are more honourable then He, &amp;c. yet
they bring not the concluſion home to the two Houſes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it doth not appeare, and they had no reaſon to take it for
granted; that the two Houſes (which they call the Parliament)
are the people in this conſideration. A Jury is the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
people, (as experience teaches, and we may finde it in Sir
<hi>Thomas Smith, l. 2. c.</hi> 26. The legall anſwer to that interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<hi>How will you be tryed,</hi> is, <hi>Dei populique judicio, by God and
my Country;</hi> and the Clerke of the Sizes replyes, <hi>Ecce tibi hi
probi viri populum repraeſentant)</hi> and the Sophiſtry would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſcovered, if we ſhould argue they are therefore more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
then the King. We may take notice alſo, that their
arguments are onely capable of concluding for the Houſe of
Commons, (and if they follow the neceſſary conſequences of
them, they muſt maintaine the Lower is above the Upper
Houſe) for the Lords ſit onely in perſonall capacities, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
thereto by the prudence of our Lawes, which thought it
reaſonable they ſhould have as great a ſhare in the government
as a negative voyce came to, becauſe they injoyed ſuch ample
revenues, that they were likely not to agree to any thing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
to the preſent ſetled State.</p>
               <p>I ſhall prove more fully in the next Section, that thoſe who
repreſent Subjects (and that but to ſome purpoſes, and not the
King to any, for this would overthrow that fundamentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of three diſtinct Eſtates) cannot be equall to, much
leſſe above their Soveraigne. And that groundleſſe invention
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52023:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which denyes ſubordination, and introduces an unheard of co-ordination,
ſuch as creates <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> and rents this
Country into diſtinct Kingdomes, ſhall be refuted.</p>
               <p>Since what is called <hi>mixt Monarchy</hi> cannot give ſuch a right
as is pleaded for, that Subjects ſhould be free to wage warre
againſt their Prince, becauſe this liberty makes two independent
States, which are not compatible in one body, but would be as
really diſtinct Kingdomes in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are;
I will endeavour to declare the true meaning thereof. If we
ſpeake properly, there cannot be ſuch a thing as <hi>mixtum Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
a mixt Monarchy, or mixt Ariſtocracy, or mixt Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Becauſe, if there are divers ſupreame powers, it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
one State. If the ſupreame power be but one (that is that
authority unto which <hi>Le dernier reſſort de la juſtice,</hi> the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
muſt be made, and againſt whoſe ſentence though unjuſt,
we have not any legall remedy) this muſt be placed either in
one man, who is the fountaine of all juriſdiction, and then it is
a Monarchicall government, or in ſome Nobles, and then the
Regiment is Ariſtocraticall, and the ſentence of the major part
of them becomes Law to all effects, whether concerning our
goods or lives; or if the civill conſtitutions of a State direct us
to appeale to the people, this is an abſolute and true Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
By a <hi>mixt Monarchy</hi> therefore (not to quarrell about
words) nothing but this can reaſonably be underſtood, that it is
not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wherein the will of the
Prince publiquely made knowne, gives the Law, <hi>Quodcunque
Principi placet, legis habet vigorem,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
not arbitrary, but reſtrained by poſitive conſtitutions,
wherein a Prince hath limited himſelfe by promiſe or oath, not
to exerciſe full power. This grant is of force, becauſe any man
may either totally reſigne, or diminiſh his rights by Covenant.
Hence it is that in Monarchies all Kings have ſupreame power,
though they have not all the ſame <hi>jura Regalia,</hi> their preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
are larger or narrower according to their particular grants.
For example, our Kings have retained to themſelves the rights
of coyning money, making great officers, beſtowing honours,
as Dukedomes, Baronies, Knighthoods, &amp;c. pardoning all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52023:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt the Crowne, making warre and peace, ſending
Ambaſſadors to negotiate with forraigne States, &amp;c. and they
have reſtrained themſelves from the uſe of that power which
makes new Lawes and repeales old, without the conſent of the
Lords and Commons in Parliament; as likewiſe from raiſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon the Subject without their conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some doe aske,</hi> How are we the better, if we muſt ſuffer him
to breake this Covenant as oft as he pleaſes? it is the ſame thing
not to have any Lawes, and not to have proviſion for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary rule and government, reſtrained by Law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile reſiſtance unlawfull, though in caſe of violation.</note> I muſt tell you, this objection is anſwered by ſhewing
there is a neceſſity that ſome body muſt be truſted. It is no
diſcretion to prevent a poſſible miſchiefe by probable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences;
if you will not truſt one you muſt truſt more, that
is, if you are weary of Monarchy (under which your fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
enjoyed happy times, and experience cannot cozen you,
though arguments may) you know the way to caſt it off by
placing ſo many guardians over your Prince, but have you any
greater aſſurance then before? <hi>Quis cuſtodiet ipſos cuſtodes?</hi>
They have as great temptations to faile their truſt as he had, and
it is likely being warned by ſuch a preſident of deſerting your
naturall Prince, they may feare your inconſtancy, and upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that you are ſubject to miſtake; and becauſe they ſuſpect
you may be <hi>willing,</hi> they will take ſuch order, you ſhall not be
<hi>able</hi> to call them to an accompt. But ſuppoſe this may not be,
and that thoſe who ſuppreſſe Tyrants (or perhaps excellent
Kings under that name) may not be frighted with their owne
example, to make uſe of their preſent power, to exerciſe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tyranny; for it is not impoſſible they ſhould grow <hi>jealous</hi>
too, and tell you plainly, they have no reaſon to <hi>truſt</hi> you. If
you deny them money, here is ground of diffidence, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
is to expoſe them to poverty, ſo to contempt, ſo to ruine.
But ſuppoſe I ſay nothing of this, but that they will be ſecure
amidſt your jealouſies, which manifeſtly endanger their ſafety;
yet you will be forced at laſt to truſt the giddy multitude, who
are alwayes weary of the preſent government, becauſe there
are ſtill ſome unavoidable defects, and theſe are diſcerned by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52023:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſenſe, and they have not ſuch depth of underſtanding as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
greater miſchiefes (which can onely be judged of by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
and therefore are eaſily perſwaded to attempt a change, ſo
that your peace is built upon a very weake foundation; you
have no better ſecurity againſt a civill warre, then that the
greater part of the people will be diſcreet. If things proſper
not according to their wiſhes, crafty men perſwade them the
fault lyes in thoſe who have the managery of the publique, and
if theſe be not removed, and honeſt and wiſe men (meaning
themſelves) put in their places, their miſeries will daily grow
upon them. A generall accuſation of ill affected, malignant
perſons, wicked Counſellors, is cauſe ſufficient to out their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
enemies of all preferments, and put their pretended
friends in their roomes. This opens a gap to all confuſion; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
warre, and moſt unnaturall diſtractions are the certaine iſſue
of it. Our owne lamentable experience confirmes this ſad
truth. After you had obtained a perfect confirmation of all
your ancient rights and liberties, with a gracious enlargement
of them by new grants, and with ſuch ſecurity as your fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were not acquainted with, you are frighted with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of a relapſe. To prevent which, it was thought fit to
take away the Kings power, with which our Lawes had inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
him, as the neceſſary meanes for our protection, becauſe
it was not impoſſible he might uſe it for our oppreſſion. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Kings Navy, His Forts, Magazines, and the Armes
of the Kingdome, are put into ſuch as you would call ſafe
hands. I doe not aske with what conſcience, but with what
judgement you did this? The want of prudence was as great
as that of honeſty, what hath beene the ſucceſſe of confiding
in thoſe whom the Lawes had not intruſted? are not your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
infinitely multiplyed? are you not extreamely ſicke of
your remedy? The tables are quite turned, and your friends
have undertaken the ſame bad game, and play it much worſe;
you onely make the ſtakes, and are in a probable way to looſe
all that you have. What one thing did you complaine of, which
is not exceeded by them? your grievances are highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52023:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Petition of Right are now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant,
they ſpeake not the ſenſe of the Houſe, but take part
with the King. To quote our good and ancient Lawes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
a breach of Priviledges of Parliament; appeales are
made to the people, the ready way to a univerſall confuſion.
And they according to private information, and miſ-guided af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
did once paſſe this ſentence, that to impriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe alleadged, and to deny <hi>Habeas corpus's,</hi> is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
upon the liberty of the Subject; to beſtow mens
eſtates by whole ſale, and take away their Money, Plate, or
Goods, doth not deſtroy the property of the Subject; To
ſcorne and revile the Booke of Common Prayer, againſt an Act
of Parliament, which ſeverely puniſhes ſuch contempt, and
to ſupplant our eſtabliſhed doctrine and diſcipline by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
Anabaptiſme and Browniſme, conduces to the holy
Reformation, and will in time effect that great worke, and
ſettle true Religion. Thus much by the way, to ſhew that we
cannot have any abſolute ſecurity; in all governments it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to truſt ſome body. For if we ſhould retaine a liberty
to right our ſelves (not to mention the fatall miſchiefes of
Anarchy, and that it is probable this freedome would be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
abuſed to our wrong, ſelfe-love making men partiall
in their owne cauſes) the deciſion of controverſies would be
writ in bloud, and we ſhould lay a fruitfull ſeed-plot of civill
warres, contrary to the end of ſociety, which is to preſerve
publique peace, though ſometimes with private loſſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though we ſuffer ſome things by injuſtice, yet we enjoy
great benefits by common tranquillity, but in the ruine of
the whole, the rights of ſingle perſons muſt be deſtroyed. The
hazard likewiſe appeares much greater, by inabling thoſe to
injure us, whom the Law hath not intruſted with our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>To anſwer their objection fully, who would perſwade the
people, there is not any differnce betweene arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and government reſtrained by lawes, if Subjects may not
compell their ſoveraigne to the obſervation of them.</p>
               <p>Greater ſecurity would undoe us. For though wee ſuffer
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52023:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſometimes under reall greivances, yet pretended breaches of
our rights (which can never be wanting, as long as ambitious
perſons are diſcontented) would have the ſame influence to
ſtirre up civill diſſentions, and it is a more prudent courſe, to
oblige ſome to ſit downe though wronged, then to open a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
way for Schiſme in the body by indulging a moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
freedome of righting themſelves. It was wiſely ſaid by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca
ſatius eſt a paucis etiam juſtam excuſationem non accipi,
quàm ab omnibus aliquam tentari.</hi> For Kingdomes are many
times diſturbed upon meere pretences. There are ſuch who
will ſet their country on fire, only to warme their owne hands
by it, and trouble the waters, that they may the better catch fiſh,
that is, who will purſue private intereſts with hazard of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
deſtruction. He that doubts this, let him conſult hiſtories,
and he ſhall find, it hath beene fatall to the beſt Princes to have
the worſt Subjects. I appeale to mens conſciences whether
they have not read, and perhaps ſcene, the reigne of a moſt
gracious Prince, a Prince eminently mercifull, and juſt, brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the odious name of Tyranny. And when malice it ſelfe
cannot blemiſh his actions, when he is not ſo bad as they could
pray for, (for they would have made great advantages, if they
could charge him with personall vices, as unchaſt, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
or negligent in performance of religious duties) yet craft
hath done their buſineſſe, and abuſed the peoples weakneſſe ſo
farr, as to make them active in their owne ruine, by that wicked
Art of declaming againſt evill counſellours. Of ſuch dangerous
conſequence is it, to open a way to civill warre upon pretended
miſcarriages in government? But grant, not fancyed, but reall
injuries, Yet
<q>
                     <l>—non tanti eſt civilia bella moveri.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, the people are then not ſo happy as they might be;
but to make uſe of force, as a remedy, will encreaſe their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.
It is certaine, this Kingdome never ſuffered ſo highly
under the greateſt tyrant, as it hath already by this unnaturall
warre, and who can tell, whither it may not end in a univerſall
deſtruction. If a King be forced to conquer againſt his will,
who knows how farre he may be tempted beyond his naturall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52023:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpoſition. It is a melancholly conſideration, that a peoples
perverſeneſſe may change a gentle Scepter into a rod of iron.
But if Subjects prevaile, we can ſee no end of the warre. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
nations will be powred upon this unhappy land, &amp; there
will never be wanting at home a conſiderable party (as long as
there are either honeſt or diſcontented men) to fight for the
regaining his haereditary rights, to keepe whom in awe, our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Subjects will plead a neceſſity of being tyrants (I could
wiſh it were not already acted upon us; firſt their will made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and then neceſſity makes their will the meaſure of
right and wrong, and deſtroyes all law) their wants will give
law to us, and impriſon us upon bare ſuſpicion of Loyalty, and
ſeize on our eſtates for feare they may be honeſtly imployed.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee a neceſſity of truſt, and that we are bound not
only in conſcience, but in prudence alſo, not to revenge the not
performance of it, I can further make it appeare, we have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good ſecurity (as ſtrong as humane wiſedome ever invented)
that we ſhall live happily, and therefore we have no reaſon to
robbe our ſelves of thoſe great bleſſings which we lately injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
peace and plenty, upon vaine feares and groundleſſe jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of imaginary miſeries. Our forefathers did not diſtruſt the
ſound temper of this policy, and they injoyed the benefits of it
in a high degree.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the King hath ſworne to preſerve our Lawes, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
our Propriety, and our Religion; and he deſires God
ſo to proſper him and his, as he performes this Oath unto the
Lord, who will require a ſevere accompt. Wee may make a
highly probable conjecture of the ſincerity of his royall heart,
and the unfeignedneſſe of his many ſacred Proteſtations from
his miraculous ſucceſſe. If God had not fought on his ſide, if
the immediate hand of providence had not ſupported him, in
mans judgment he had beene ſwallowed up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if he ſhould command any illegall things, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
of them are reſponſable, and muſt make ſatisfaction to
the injur'd parties. And they cannot flatter themſelves with
hopes of impunitie, for once in three yeares a Parliament will
call them to accompt, and they have a great Democraticall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52023:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the obtaining juſtice. Becauſe the Kings wants
cannot be ſupplyed without their conſent, and it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
he will deny any reaſonable petitions, or reject any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
but ſuch as robbe him of his honour, which is infinitely
deare to him above plenty; except they endeavour to make him
worſe then poore, (which cannot be by demanding juſtice) it
is moſt probable he will readily aſſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His intereſts are the ſame with the Subjects. They
are not like two buckets, when one is loweſt, the other is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
but they reſemble the Head and reſt of the Members, and
the Head cannot thrive by a conſumption of the Members. Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall
gainings from the people are ſhifts rather then true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy;
they may ſerve a preſent turne, yet are not worth the
price at which they are purchaſed, envy and diſcontents; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the gratitude of the Subject is a conſtant and cheerefull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.
When the King, like the Sunne, in conſideration of
what is drawne up from them, ſhall returne it in plentifull
ſhowres, and the bleſſings of a juſt government, which makes
a Land fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds wee have very good reaſon to promiſe
to our ſelves a happy government; our hopes are much above
our feares, eſpecially after his greater experience of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
conſequences of ſome miſcarriages, and the ſtrange bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
upon his ſtrict obſervation of the certaine and knowne
Lawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that require fuller information in the nature of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
may finde ample ſatisfaction in</hi> Stawnford, Dyer,
Crompton, <hi>and Sir</hi> Edward Coke, <hi>That the King is the fountain
of all juſtice, and conſequently that the Lawes have placed the
ſupreame power in the Crowne. I have choſen rather to ſhew
it out of</hi> Bracton, <hi>a man worthily famous for his knowledge in
the Civill and Common Law, becauſe the booke is leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and I finde his authority often abuſed to juſtifie their

power in all civill cauſes, and is</hi> ſuper omnes, <hi>over all
perſons, over the body politique; all juriſdictions are in him;
the materiall ſword of right belongs to him, and whatſoever
conduces to peace, that the people committed to his charge
may lead peaceable and quiet lives. The power of holding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes
is derived from him, and of puniſhing delinquents. For

to protect us by defending them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe concluſions are naturally deduced from his premiſes.
To diſpoſe the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome without the conſent
of the Soveraigne (and much more againſt his expreſſe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition)
is illegall. To iſſue Commiſſions by any other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
then his, for killing and ſlaying, or taking mens eſtates by
force, is againſt the known Lawes: and to forbid the holding
of Aſſizes (upon whatever pretence of advancing the Subjects
property, by ſtopping the courſe of Juſtice,) is deſtructive of
the rights both of King and Subjects.</p>

is the right to defend the Kingdome. <hi>Populi ſalus,</hi> the ſafety

<hi>Adeò de autoritate juris noſtra pendet autoritas. l. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna,
c. de legib.</hi> The meaning may be extended thus farre.
That the people had a hand in the conveyance of their divided
rights into him, and he may now challenge them by vertue of
their owne agreement, and by divine right alſo, but as preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this conſent; becauſe God doth not immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of Kingdomes now, and conqueſt ſignifies greater force
not juſter title; that oft times gives poſſeſſion, and a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
compact creates a true right. I doe not deny, but that
conqueſt in ſome caſes may be a lawfull way of acquiſition; the
provocation may be ſo great, that perſons and eſtates are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
to the victor; but becauſe the will is not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced, it doth not follow, he hath got a right over their
goods and bodies, therefore they are His Subjects, and owe to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52023:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him obedience. For to be ſubject, being a morall bond, where
God doth not lay upon us any obligation, (as the duty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
towards their Parents doth not depend upon choice) it
can only flow from our conſent. But this conſent of the people
was not an adequate cauſe, but a neceſſary qualification to make
him capable of receiving a larger commiſſion from God. The
Sword of Juſtice is blunt, the peoples agreement could not
put an edge upon it to cut off offenders, this is done by the
Magiſtrate, as Gods delegate.</p>
               <p>That the King is <hi>ſub lege,</hi> under the law, hath this ſenſe,
That he ought to governe according to thoſe ſtanding rules.
His Majeſty freely confeſſes this obligation, and ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath taught him the benefits of ſtrict obſervance, he will
not be intreated upon what plauſible pretences ſoever (and
much leſſe will he be commanded) to recede from their known
and certaine direction. But if he ſhould ſwerve from theſe
rules, he is not liable to any puniſhment, nor compellible by
ſtrong hand; not for want of ſinne, for he offends highly in that
caſe, but for want of a ſuperiour juriſdiction. <hi>Bracton</hi> delivers
this truth plainly, wee have no legall remedy, wee can onely

for want of foreſight are in the King: ſo that it gives
not power to him to make new or abrogate old Lawes without
conſent in Parliament, but the right of interpretation belongs to
him, not in plaine and evident caſes (for theſe need no declarer;
to challenge a right to declare all Lawes, were in effect to make
them, and then all the Subjects rights would be in their breſts,
and depend upon arbitrary votes) but only in new queſtions
and, doubts which muſt not be reſolved contrary to old Law.
By this it appeares that Subjects ought not to judge of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable
part of Law, and to overthrow the literall ſenſe at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to the praejudice of their Soveraigne. Our King hath as

and therefore it cannot ſerve their turne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſecondly the words
following (craftily left out) ſhew the abſurdity of it, the reaſon
of the ſpeech is,</hi> quia Comites dicuntur quaſi ſocii Regis, et qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet

hath a fellow <hi>(or a Peere)</hi> hath a Maſter. And therefore if the
King will indulge himſelfe a looſeneſſe from all Lawes, they ought to
impoſe thoſe bonds upon him, except they alſo will caſt off obedience
to eſtabliſhed Lawes. Then, <hi>he ſayes,</hi> no farther remedy is left but

               <p>
                  <hi>The diſtinct anſwer to it is, that</hi> Bracton <hi>layes not this downe

               <p>It would be very eaſy, for one better read in our Lawes, then
I am, to ſhew that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath ſupreame right,
from the nature of all Subjects lands holden of him in fee; which
though it gives a perpetuall eſtate,<note place="margin">Kings ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie proved from the nature of all his Subjects <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures.</hi>
                  </note> yet not abſolute, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall,
for it depends upon the acknowledgement of ſuperiority
and is forfaitable upon a not performance of ſome duties, and
therefore it returnes unto him. For the breach of Fidelity is
loſſe of Fee, as appeares in <hi>Duarenus, Weſembechius, Farinaccius,
Molina, Socinus, Gail,</hi> and they tell us that all Lawyers agree,
that all <hi>Feuda</hi> are loſt by rebellion; as alſo by our common Law,
which according to the nature of the treſpaſſe, varies the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In caſe of Treaſon, as taking up Armes againſt the King,
(for ſo you may find it determined 25 <hi>Edw. 3. c. 2.)</hi> after legall
conviction all their lands and tenements are abſolutely in the
Kings diſpoſall; in caſe of felony, the King hath a yeare, a day
and the waſt, after which it paſſeth downe to the heires. It is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52023:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very evident, that the King onely hath that high degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in his lands which Lawyers call <hi>alaudium</hi> or <hi>alodium.</hi> The
ſenſe is the ſame though the words differ; for it is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
whether with <hi>Budaeus</hi> we derive it from the privative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>(a)</hi> and <hi>Laudum,</hi> which ſignifies, nomination, ſo that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
<hi>praedium cujus nullus author eſt niſi Deus:</hi> to hold in his

from God onely, or like to thoſe of <hi>Heinault,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no tenure but from God and the Sunne, <hi>Pays de Hainault

privative particle <hi>(a)</hi> and the Saxon <hi>Leod,</hi> or the French <hi>leud</hi> (a
vaſſall or leigeman) and then it expreſſes thus much, a tenement
without vaſſallage, <hi>without burden,</hi> to which our Engliſh <hi>Loade</hi>
retaines ſome reſemblance.</p>
               <p>But Subjects of what degree or condition ſoever hold their
lands <hi>ut feuda,</hi> in the nature of <hi>Fee,</hi> which implies Fealty to a
ſuperior. It is all one whether they belong to them by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or by purchaſe; for though they may ſometimes be dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bought, yet ſuch is the condition of the alienation, that they
cannot be conveyed without thoſe burdens which were layed
upon him who had <hi>novell Fee.</hi> So that <hi>Camden</hi> pag. 93. of his
<hi>Britannia,</hi> obſerves very truly, that the King only hath <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
dominium,</hi> this being reſerved by the conouerour, who
changed many of our lawes, and introduced the cuſtomes of
Normandy, and inſtituted all our pleas in French, and paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>utile dominium</hi> only; he gave though not abſolute yet
perpetuall right, conditions being performed to uſe and enjoy
ſuch and ſuch lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The higheſt expreſſion of a Subjects right
which law will juſtify, is this, <hi>ſeiſitus inde in dominico ſuo, ut de
feudo. He is ſeized of ſuch lands in his demaine, as of fee.</hi> Now
<hi>Feudum</hi> is manifeſtly a derived right, and founded in him who
hath ſupreame right, in conſideration whereof all lands held by
Subjects are burdened with ſome ſervices, which differ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the variety of grant from the King. Hence ſome tenures
expire with life, others goe downe to our poſterity by diſcent,
to whom the law gives <hi>uſum fructum,</hi> a right to uſe, injoy and
make all profits, but they are properly but <hi>meſn</hi> or <hi>meſme</hi>

the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings ſupremacy is as ſtrongly proved in, that he is our
<hi>Leige Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leige Lord</hi> bound to ſome duties,</note> as appeares by ſundry Statutes, for ſuch an one can
acknowledge no ſuperiour, as <hi>Duarenus</hi> ſhewes in comment. <hi>de

ligii,</hi> leige men, and owe faith, and true alleagiance to
him, as their ſuperiour. The definition of Legeancy is ſet down
in the great cuſtomary of <hi>Normandy, Ligeantia eſt ex quâ domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
tenentur vaſſalli ſui</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ligeancy is an obligation upon all
Subjects to take part with their leige Lord againſt all men living,
to aid and aſſiſt with their bodies and minds, with their adviſe and
power, not to lift up their armes againſt him, nor to ſupport in any
way thoſe who oppoſe him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">but not under paine of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Leige men</hi> are.</note> The Lord like wiſe is bound to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,
protect, and defend his leige people (ſo the Engliſh are
often called in Acts of Parliament) according to the rights, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
and lawes of the Country. If Subjects breake their
faith and prove diſloyall, their eſtates and lives are expreſſely
forfeited; and the King is enabled by law (as the fountaine of all
Juriſdiction) to ſeize upon their goods and lands, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their perſons. If he performe not his duty (for there is
a mutuall obligation betweene leige Lord and leige men) yet
notwithſtanding this failing, neither his Crowne or any rights
belonging to his Royall dignity are ſubject to forfeiture. Let
them if they can produce any one law to maintaine their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If there had beene any, it would not thus long have been
concealed, for they are not accuſtomed to diſſemble any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by overmuch modeſty. Indeed they have not any
ſhadow of proofe or colour of reaſon for it; and yet upon their
bare word how many thouſands have hazarded their ſoules by
aſſiſting rebells, which are eternally loſt, if they periſh in their
ſinne? What madneſſe is it to beleeve their ſaying, before their
and your owne oathes? Is it poſſible you can innocently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
your Soveraigne, whoſe life you have ſworne to defend
with your utmoſt power? Be not abuſed by that miſerable fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
drawne from the nature of a Covenant. The miſtake lies
here, that law hath provided to bring Subjects offending to a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52023:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tryall, but hath not, could not queſtion the King, and compell
him to be reſponſable, for want of a ſuperiour juriſdiction, All
juſt proceedings muſt be <hi>per legale judicium parium, &amp; legem
terrae, by triall of Peeres and the law of the land.</hi> But the King
hath no <hi>Peere,</hi> and <hi>lex terrae</hi> doth not in any caſe diſarme the
King of the ſword of Juſtice, it is not ſeparable from his
Crowne. Therefore he is exempt from tryall, and it cannot be
juſt to puniſh him unheard, uncondemned. The conditions of
Kings were very miſerable, if he who ſweares to governe the
people according to the knowne lawes, ſo that they ſee what to
truſt to, ſhould himſelfe be liable to their arbitrary Juſtice.
The Premiſes are firme; for the Major is part of <hi>magna charta,</hi>
and the Minor is as evident, as that his Subjects are not greater
then he; which ſignifies only, that thoſe which are under him
are not his ſuperiours. <hi>Bracton,</hi> you may remember, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the expreſſion, <hi>Rex non habet parem in regno,</hi> and he is
<hi>tantùm ſub Deo &amp;c.</hi> There is beſides an antient monument,
which ſhewes the manner of holding a Parliament before the
Conqueſt, which will afford us no ſmall light in this poynt. It
is ſayed to be delivered to <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> by diſcreet
men, at his command, and to have beene approved by him; it
runs thus, <hi>Rex eſt caput, principium &amp; finis Parliamenti &amp; ita
non habet parem in ſuo gradu</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King is the head, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
and the end of the Parliament and ſo he hath not any Peere
or equall, but is himſelfe the firſt degree. The</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>is of Archbiſhops
Biſhops, Abbots and Priors holding by Baroney. The</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>is of
Proctors of the Clergy. The fourth is of Earles, Barons and other
noble perſonages. The fifth is of Knights of the Shire. The ſixt
degree is of Citizens and Burgeſſes, and ſo the whole Parliament
is compleated by ſix degrees. But we muſt know that though any
of the five degrees beſides the King, ſhall be abſent, if they were
duely ſummoned, Parliamentum nihilominus cenſetur eſſe plenum,</hi>
the <hi>Parliament is full in law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter part is as manifeſtly true, that <hi>Lex terrae</hi> doth not
in any caſe diſarme the King of the ſword of Juſtice. By our
conſtitutions <hi>Regia majeſtas eſt armis decorata</hi> and <hi>legibus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi>
the <hi>directive</hi> part of Law concernes the King, the <hi>penall</hi>

doth not; Hee ought to ſquare his actions according to this
rule, but if they ſhould ſwerve from it, they cannot fall within
the cognizance of his Subjects. All offences are puniſhable as
committed againſt Him, His Crowne and Dignity, and though
the Law hath condemned them, they are pardonable by His
<hi>Grace:</hi> which clearely demonſtrates, He is above penall Lawes,
and it is indeed an inſeparable priviledge of ſupreame juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
let it be placed where it will, in one or more perſons.
Naturally, (ſuppoſing men by diſtance abſolved from paternall
dominion) that is, before a poſitive conſtitution of Empire,
when men were equally free, it was not unlawfull to require by
ſtrong hand ſatisfaction for wrong; but after an eſtabliſhed
government, this liberty was civilly reſtrained; and it is not in
our power to right our ſelves but in a legall way, which is by
Magiſtrates; and the laſt appeale lyes to the higheſt Governour,
that the proceſſe may not be infinite, but we may have ſome
certaine and peaceable deciſion of all differences.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Section, (for I ſhall have occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my proofes in the next, in anſwer to their exceptions) we
have ſworne to beare true allegiance to the King, (ſuch as have

reſtrained their malice from effecting it, yet by ſhooting at him,
by attempting to kill him, they are loſt temporally, their goods
and chattels, lands and tenements, and lives, are forfeited in
Law; and what is moſt lamentable, their ſoules are eternally
ruined. Diſloyalty to their King is diſobedience to God, I need

caſe is ſo extreamely plaine, I am amazed that the people ſhould

ſuffer. I ſpeake alwayes of private men.</hi> This truth clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
ſpeakes the goodneſſe of the cauſe, and demonſtrates
the unlawfulneſſe of taking up Armes againſt the King, though
their ſuppoſition were true (as it is evidently falſe) that His
Majeſtie did caſt off the bridle of eſtabliſhed Lawes, whereas
He doth hazard His Life and Crowne in their defence. The
quarrell is, that he doth obſtinately maintaine our good old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and conſtitutions (ſuch as experience hath confirmed
happy and beneficiall to this Nation) and will not be over awed
to make new Lawes, ſuch as private intereſts would force upon
Him and the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This is a ſure ground for conſcience to rely upon, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deſtructive of moſt of their popular principles, which
have poyſoned the affections of the Subjects. It is not lawfull
for us to correct ill Governours, becauſe this cannot be effected
without reſiſtance, and all private men have direct precept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this; that of obedience and patience. This will ſpeake
home to the buſineſſe, when it will after appeare, that all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Magiſtrates oppoſed to the higheſt, whoſe Delegates and
Miniſters they are, are but private men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the meane while, wee may hence diſcover the falſhood
of their principles,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> the law of nature will juſtifie all
reſiſtance againſt injuries, and for our owne preſervation; that
no people is ſo mad as to contract to their owne ruine, <hi>(and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may reſiſt any Magiſtrate, if their lives be indangered; the
meaning is, if they have offended againſt known Lawes, which
will certainly adjudge them to dye, the Magiſtrate ſhall bring
them to a legall tryall at his owne perill)</hi> or to agree to be ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;
and therefore ſince there is a mutuall compact, if Rulers
performe not their duty, the contract is diſſolved, and they are at
liberty to right themſelves, and to governe their Governours, and
to fling the Pilot over-board, if he wilfully ſteere upon the Rocks,
not by way of juriſdiction, but ſelfe-preſervation. <hi>That the King
is for the people, and Governours are appoynted for the good
of thoſe that are governed, and</hi> therefore Subjects are the more
conſiderable men, and greater and more honourable then thoſe
who are placed over them, they bearing relation of the end, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52023:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but of the meanes, and <hi>ſo the ſafety of the people muſt
give Law to the Magiſtrate, if he will be peeviſh, and protect
them according to old Lawes, when they fancy greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
from innovation; that</hi> Quicquid efficit tale, eſt magis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
<hi>but</hi> according to their grounds, private men made all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
(for before they conſtituted ſome forme of Regiment by
pactions and agreements, they were but a multitude of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whome none had juriſdiction over other) <hi>the concluſion is,</hi>
therefore private men are more Magiſtrates, and may call even
the higheſt to accompt, and force him to be reſponſable for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they judge abuſe of power.</p>
               <p>The grounds upon which our ſeditious writers doe argue, are
very contradictory in themſelves, and yet all of them conclude
for Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Some (and I thinke the greater part) confeſſe it is unlawfull
for private men to reſiſt the Magiſtrate, though abuſing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Theſe muſt needs acknowledge the weakeneſſe of
thoſe arguments (which yet they conſtantly preſſe, and which
prevaile moſt upon the peoples affections) that it is a ſenſeleſſe
thing to imagine, wee can be obliged to be ſlaves, in caſe a
King be guided by his Luſts, not Lawes, or not to preſerve our
ſelves againſt bloudy Tyrants. For their determination is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that private men for want of authority to arme them,
are bound to ſuffer. And <hi>Calvin</hi> is expreſſe, <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 10. §. 6.
<hi>nullum magis praeclarum facinus habetur, etiam apud philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,
quàm liberare tyrannide patriam. Atqui voce coeleſtis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitri
apertè damnatur, qui privatus manum tyranno intulerit.</hi>
They maintaine therefore, though private men ſinne in reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting;
yet if countenanced by inferior Magiſtrates, then it is
not Rebellion, but a juſt Warre. Theſe may be clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
if they will but conſider, that inferior Magiſtrates are
ſuch only in reſpect of thoſe who are under their juriſdiction,
becauſe to them they repreſent the King, but in reference to the
King, they themſelves are but Subjects, and can challenge not
juriſdiction over him.</p>
               <p>Some ſtate it thus; though not private men, not yet inferior
Magiſtrates, yet ſuperior powers may bridle the exorbitant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52023:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
luſts of Princes by force of Armes; this wee grant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
acknowledge, that in an Ariſtocracy where the lawes place
the ſupreme power in ſuch a body of men, what is done by
their authority ought not to be reſiſted, and if any one man
take upon him regall power contrary to their conſtitutions he
is a Traytor, and may be cut off. But this concludes nothing in
a Monarchy, <hi>Res apud alios acta, aliis non praejudicat;</hi> for their
error is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They make the two Houſes the Kings ſuperiors; who
themſelves diſclaime it in words, and ſeeme to aske you, who
made them ſupreme Ruler; for all their petitions (which are
the acts of them not as <hi>ſingle</hi> men, but as <hi>united</hi> bodies, and
conſidered <hi>unitivè,</hi> not <hi>disjunctivè; ſocially,</hi> not <hi>ſeverally)</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
this truth in the Title, <hi>Your Majeſties humble and obedient
Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> which
acknowledges their obligation to be under him; and to ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
would be of dangerous conſequence, for if they be
not His Subjects, they put themſelves out of His protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Some againe thinke it too groſſe and abſurd to maintaine,
that Subjects in any capacity are above their King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>coordination</hi> ſerves their turne. By which if they meane
an equall right in the King and the two Houſes of a negative
voyce, in reſpect of new Lawes to be enacted, or old abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
this is granted, but will doe them no ſervice, and indeed
it overthrowes their cauſe. For as the King doth not pretend
that he can make uſe of his power to make new lawes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their conſent, ſo by the ſame reaſon, neither can they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a right of taking away our old Government without the
Royall aſſent. But if they meane by coordination, a diviſion of
Soveraignty, this is againſt the nature of it, and a cleare contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
So that if he be our onely Soveraigne there is no ſuch
thing as coordination; if they be joynt-Soveraignes, in what a
miſerable condition are we <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> who ſhould be bound
to impoſſibilities, to obey three maſters commanding contrary
things? They might as well challenge us to doe homage to
them, which is and ought to be performed onely to the King,
<hi>tum per id efficiamur homines ſolius illius cui juravimus,</hi> as the

               </p>
               <p>Some, and thoſe the moſt deſperate mutineers, lay ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as will bring in a certaine confuſion: For they tell us
obedience is commanded onely to good Magiſtrates; if men
intruſted to governe according to Law faile in their duty, they
ceaſe to be Magiſtrates, for theſe are defined <hi>Dei miniſtri nobis

ſo that to deſtroy ſuch is to reſiſt the <hi>men</hi> onely, and
not the <hi>power;</hi> it is a warre againſt the <hi>perſon</hi> onely, and not
the <hi>authority,</hi> which is none, if uſed againſt Law, becauſe that

                  </gap>, what they ought to doe in right.</p>
               <p>This is the moſt reaſonable doctrine, becauſe coherent to it
ſelfe throughout, but the moſt ſeditious doctrine likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it gives a full liberty to the people, not onely in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
body, (and therefore in the diffuſive much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the right <hi>that</hi> can pretend to againſt the King, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from <hi>this)</hi> but to any part of them, to any private man to
reſume (as ſome expreſſe it) their power, or as others to make
uſe of that power, which they never parted with to their owne
inconvenience, and ſo all neceſſity of ſuffering, except when
they have deſerved it, is taken away, and Chriſtianity is made
a tame madneſſe.</p>
               <p>To returne to <hi>Calvin,</hi> whoſe following words are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
(though I muſt confeſſe ſome conceive them craftily laid
downe by him, in reference to the time and place when and
where he lived, and that his deſigne was to inſinuate ſome ſmall
colour in plauſible Generalls, for that moſt unjuſtifiable action
of the Citizens of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who had lately caſt off their true
Prince, becauſe a Biſhop of a contrary religion) after he hath
informed us, that God requires all private men to obey or ſuffer
though under Tyrants, he addes, <hi>Nam ſi qui nunc ſint populares
magiſtratus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If there be at this time any Magiſtrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Law, in behalfe of the people, to reſtraine the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of Kings, ſuch as were the</hi> Ephori, <hi>oppoſed and ſet over
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52023:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the</hi> Lacedaemonian <hi>Kings, the Tribunes of the people which cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the</hi> Roman <hi>Conſuls, and the</hi> Demarchi <hi>who bridled the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
at</hi> Athens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon this ſuppoſition <hi>they not onely may,
but ought to reforme the abuſes of government, and to doe right
to the poore Commonalty whoſe guardians they are.</hi> This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably
true, but impertinent to the preſent controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the People or Nobles cannot challenge that power in a
Monarchy, with which they are inveſted under an Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or Democratical regiment, ſuch as <hi>Athens, Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Sparta</hi> were.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable by the way, that by reaſon the ſupreame
power was placed in the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Ephori, and <hi>Roman</hi>
Tribunes, &amp;c. their office made their perſons ſacred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.
They did juſtly challenge the ſame impunity, which we
maintaine, belongs to Kings in a true Monarchy; for I argue
not from the name, (for though the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
King, it would not inlarge his authority, and the <hi>Spartan</hi>
Kings had onely a Royall title, but were truly Subjects as we
learne from <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Polybius)</hi> but from the nature of that
power wherewith the conſtitutions of a Realme doe inveſt one
perſon. Hence appeares the unreaſonableneſſe of their ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
invectives founded upon ſome inconveniences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
power will probably be ſooner abuſed, if any perſon
may doe what he will, and not be reſponſable for his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Theſe kinde of Declamations, with which their
Preſſes and Pulpits labour, ſtrike equally at all government. For
there is a neceſſity we ſhould lie open to ſome poſſible evils
from the abuſe of authority, or elſe we cannot provide for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and certaine goods of common peace and publique tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
It is no prudence to cure the miſcarriages of government
by a legall confuſion, ſince even the worſt government is leſſe
miſerable then Anarchy.</p>
               <p>I beleeve I can make a full diſcovery of thoſe wicked Arts
whereby crafty men have opened a way to the advancement of
their covetous and ambitious deſignes at the price of publique
calamity. <hi>Tib. Gracchus</hi> was excellently learned in thoſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52023:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
politiques; and I deſire all indifferent men to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the unhappy diſturbers of <hi>England</hi> have not exactly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the miſeries of this Kingdome according to his principles.
He propoſed ſome Lawes which might well become a reall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of his Country,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Graccus</hi> his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne.</note> but his violence in the illegall eſtabliſhment
of them, which did evidently tend to confuſion, did make it
apparent, that publique pretences were taken up in order to the
ſatisfaction of private luſts. <hi>Marcus Octavius,</hi> as his fellow
Tribune had the right of a negative voice, for if one Tribune
diſſented, no Ordinance could be made which ought to have
the power of Law. He not able to effect his ends, informes the
people that this oppoſition betweene their equall authorities
did threaten civill warre, and therefore it would concerne them
as they loved their owne ſafety, which was the ſupreame Law,
to decide this difference, by recalling that power which they
had beſtowed, to the end they might receive benefit therefrom;
but which was now abuſed contrary to a truſt repoſed, to their
prejudice. The iſſue was, he prevailed with them to depoſe
<hi>Octavius,</hi> and he made them ſubſtitute a meane perſon, one of
his dependants. But being ſenſible afterwards, that amongſt
all his illegall Acts, this gave moſt diſtaſte, not onely to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, who were indued with clearer underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but even to the ſlowly apprehending Commons, and that
it proceeded from lawleſſe paſſion to debaſe the higheſt dignity
of Tribune of the people, and expoſe that ſacred function to
ſcorne and contempt, which ever before was juſtly eſteemed
inviolable, and ſuch as ſecured the perſons from being touched,
hee brings theſe colours to excuſe that moſt unpreſidented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Authority</hi> of Tribunes is truly ſacred and inviolable, but
for no other cauſe then as particularly devoted to protect the
people, and eſtabliſhed to advance their welfare: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>perſon</hi> thus highly intruſted, failes in performance of
duty, ſuffers the people for whom he ſerves, to be oppreſſed,
and endeavours to abridge their power, and denyes to them
the meanes of expreſſing their will and pleaſure by his vote;
(for he is but their mouth, enabled by them to declare their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52023:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meaning.) In this caſe he forfeits all Prividedges and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
due to his office, becauſe hee thwarts thoſe very ende
which firſt moved the people to beſtow upon him ſuch large
preeminences: for if otherwiſe we muſt be bound to ſit ſtill,
while he pulls downe the Capitoll, or ſets the Navy on fire,
and notwithſtanding any violences, or whatever exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his luſts and wildeſt paſſions, tamely to obey him as
our Tribune, that is ſuch an one who by vertue of our truſt for
the improvement of our ſafety, uſurpes a right to cut our
throats, and is our ſervant to deſtroy us. Certainly if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſtop that breath which created him, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the underived authority of the people, he is no longer
their Tribune. Is it not a moſt unreaſonable thing, that a
Tribune may impriſon the Conſull, if it conduce to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the State, becauſe in that the peoples ſafety is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
and yet that the people cannot depoſe him in their
own defence, and reſume their power when imployed to their
ruine? For as the Conſul, ſo the Tribune likewiſe is the peoples
creature; they live and move and have their being in their
election. Againe, Regall dignity (in which the powers of all
other Magiſtrates of what degree or ranke ſoever, were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and made up a perſonall Soveraignty) was declared ſacred
and holy by the moſt ſolemne and moſt religious Ceremonies,
as approaching nearer to, and partaking much of Divinity:
nevertheleſſe the people expell'd <hi>Tarquin,</hi> abuſing his Royall
power, and ſome perſonall faults were thought a ſufficient
reaſon to take away the moſt ancient Magiſtracy, and that
which founded <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. There are not in this Citie any
perſons more holy, more venerable, then thoſe pure votareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the veſtall virgines, whoſe charge it is to preſerve the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
fire. But if they ſtaine their honour, our Law buryes
them alive: They cannot challenge any priviledges belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ſacred employment, becauſe when they ceaſe to
reſpect the Gods, we no longer owe a reverence to them,
which is paid onely in order to their ſervice of the Gods. Can
it then be reaſonable to ſuffer the peoples enemy, to enjoy the
priviledges due to their Protector? He would cut off thoſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52023:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hands which hold him up. If the conſent of the major part
could make him Tribune, ſhall not the ſame power which did
conſtitute be equally ſtrong to diſſolve? and much more can
a greater power depoſe him, the concurrence even of the
whole people declaring him unworthy. What is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what leſſe to be violated, then things offered up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to the Gods? And yet no man dares forbid the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to make uſe of theſe, or to remove them from one place
to another, as oft as they ſhall judge it convenient ſo to doe.
By the ſame reaſon, without diſhonour to the Authority,
they may diſcharge the perſon, and chooſe out a better habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for that ſacred office. That the Magiſtrate is ſeparable
from the man is evident, becauſe many, when made by the
people, out of a love to a retired life, or a ſenſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and unfitneſſe to manage the publique, have depoſed
themſelves, others have intreated the people to chooſe more
able ſervants. <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in the life of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Gajus
Gracchi.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſſe to make the application. Obſerve the event;
This illegall deed (which was juſtifyed only by a pretended
neceſſity, for I know not what imminent dangers did threaten
the Common-wealth, except this Bill did paſle) being ventured
on by the unconſidering multitude to avoyd Civill Warre, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ready meanes to kindle it. The flames of which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
conſumed the author, with many of his adherents. For
one <hi>Naſica</hi> ſo managed <hi>Gracchus</hi> his ſeditious principles, that
he killed him with his owne weapons. For taking advantage
of the many diſcontents, he requires the Conſull to aide the
publique ſafety, by deſtroying him who had uſurped a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
power. The Conſul replyes with much moderation, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and prudence, <q>It did not become him to make force the
meaſure of right, nor could he kill a common Citizen, before he
were brought to a legall tryall, &amp; condemnation had paſt upon
him. But he promiſes, if the people either ſeduced or awed by
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſhould Vote any Ordinance contrary to eſtabliſhed
Lawes, he would eſteeme it of no force, and would not yield
to the obſervance of it.</q> 
                  <hi>Naſica</hi> riſes up in a rage, and gives the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52023:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
word to the Tumult, ſince then the chiefe Magiſtrate neglect
the common ſafety, wee muſt not be wanting to our owne
preſervation; ſuch as will maintain the reverence due to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
authority, follow me. In this mutiny <hi>Tiberius</hi> falls a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the publique peace.—Stones and Staves were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weapons by which this popular man, and above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of his companions were deſtroyed. The behaviour of
<hi>Bloſſius</hi> a great incendiary, and an over active inſtrument to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
wicked deſignes, is very remarkable. He being arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Conſuls, confeſſes freely, he had executed what
ever <hi>Tiberius</hi> had commanded him. <hi>Naſica</hi> askes him, what
he would have done if he had beene commanded to fire the
Capitoll; He replyes, <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not have commanded
ſuch a thing; others preſſe hard upon him to tell his reſolution,
in caſe <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould have commanded it; He plainely tells
them, he had then done it, being confident <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not
have commanded it, except it were for the good of the people.
The parallel will be defective, if there have not beene unhappy
inſtruments who captivating their ſenſe to an implicite ſaith,
and beleeving not what themſelves feele, but what others
Vote, are active in their owne ruine in purſuance of ſafety, and
pull upon themſelves miſery and deſtruction in obedience to
thoſe Ordinances, which tell them the Subjects happineſſe is
thereby advanced.</p>
               <p>There are other circumſtances fit to be taken notice of. He
had provoked ſo many, he did not dare to be a private man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
(not any <hi>perſonall ambition,</hi> but only <hi>State jealouſie</hi>
would not permit him to lay downe his power) and therefore
he ſo contrives his buſineſſe, that the people may chooſe him
Tribune the following yeare, not ſo much to ſatisfie any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
deſire (for he would ſeeme to rule only in obedience to
their commands) as to provide for their good in his owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The way to this end was to court the Commons by all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Artes. He propounded new edicts, by which the time of
military ſervice was ſhortned, and ſome yeares were cut off
from the prefixed number, in which Roman Citizens were
bound, when called upon to performe the duties of Warre. He
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52023:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made it lawfull to appeale from any ſentence to the judgment
of the people. To the Senate (in whom only before the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to adminiſter juſtice did reſide) he joyned an equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the inferior Commons, ſo that a major part of them,
with a minor part of Senators, if they made the major part of
the whole, did ſway all buſineſſes. Thus, ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> by
all poſſible wayes, leſſening and weakning the authority of the
Senate by creating greater power in the people, rather out of
wilfullneſſe and obſtinacy, then ſound reaſon, which muſt
needs perceive, it was voyd of all Juſtice, and very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the publique intereſt. He had ſome other little
Artes which ſtood him in good ſtead; when the Votes of the
people were to be numbred to authorize his edicts, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his adverſaries would prevaile in number, becauſe ſome
of his party were abſent, he would take ſome opportunity to
picke a quarrell with his fellowes, only to divert the buſineſſe
for the preſent, and gaine time, and if that would not doe, he
would diſmiſſe the aſſembly, and command another meeting.
Then would he appeare firſt upon the place in mourning appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
and with afflicted lookes, and humble countenance, ſadly
requeſting the people to take compaſſion on him, who ſuffered
ſuch miſerable things, and feared worſe only for doing them
ſervice; and deſiring them to reward his faithfull endeavour
by loving his poore Wife and little Children, for he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for a loſt man, ſince he had reaſon to feare (yet the cauſe
in which he ſhould fall was an unſpeakable comfort) that the
enemies of the Common-wealth, and ſuch as maligned their
happineſſe, would come upon him in the night, and force his
houſe, and murther him. Theſe well diſſembled griefes ſo

for miſtake by an ungrounded conjecture, <hi>Et quâ etiam

<hi>perhaps, peradventure,</hi> if this chance to be otherwiſe,
you have nothing to ſay for your ſelves; you are condemned
out of his mouth, and in a poynt of ſuch higly concerning
conſequences, you have no reaſon to change his adverbe of
doubting into an aſſertive. I ſhall oppoſe to his <hi>perhaps,</hi> it is
certainely not ſo in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe our Lawes make this a
Monarchicall government, and ſo different from that of <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <p>The worke of the ſecond ſection was, to prove it unlawfull

grounded upon what cauſes ſoever, as indeavours to make
them ſlaves or beggars, or to introduce another and a falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and what elſe may be comprehended under the extreame
abuſe of this power to their oppreſſion, or upon any perſons,

The <hi>fuller anſwere to Doctor Ferne</hi> ſaith thus,

               <p>The Author extreamely contradicts this duty, before profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

downe a moſt deſperate concluſion, which diſſolves all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement

reigne over you; and it amounted to this, to deſtroy their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and property.</hi> Calvin <hi>drawes this concluſion from it;</hi>
Kings could not doe ſo according to right, becauſe the Law was
againſt it, which inſtructed them in their duty to governe juſtly;
but it was called <hi>jus in populum,</hi> a right over the people, to which
they muſt needs be ſubject; nor was it lawfull for them to reſiſt.

                  <hi>It is a frivolous objection</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that this precept concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

The counſell hence inferred is very good, let not us
therefore breake our duty, becauſe Kings performe not theirs.
If we live under a bloudy Prince, or covetous, or intemperate,
or weake, or one that perſecutes the moſt godly profeſſors, let
us call to minde our own ſins, which have deſerved greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations.
Let us thinke it is Gods ſword, the ſword of Juſtice,
though man commit murther with it. If we have deſerved to
die, and the Law paſſe ſentence upon us, we ought not to be
impatient, though we be cut off by a wicked executioner.</p>

I will ſet downe his words at large, for they are ſo ſtrange, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
men might doubt the faith of a relater.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Certaine it is, That the frame and tenor of Gods after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
did require, that ſuch a liberty ſhould be hid from
them; or at leaſt, that they ſhould not make uſe of it; as on
the contrary, the nature and purport of thoſe diſpenſations
which God hath now in hand, requires that this liberty
ſhould be manifeſted, and made known unto Chriſtians. We
know, that according to the counſell and foreknowledge of
God, Antichriſt was then to come into the world: as now
wee know that he is about to be deſtroyed, and caſt out of
the world. Now this is a generall rule, looke what truthes
were neceſſary to be ſhut up, and concealed from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt, that Antichriſt might paſſe by, and get up into
his throne; the diſcovery and letting out of the ſame into the
world, are neceſſary for his pulling downe, &amp;c. But God
cauſing a dead ſleep (as it were) to fall upon thoſe truthes
which ſhould in ſpeciall manner have oppoſed him, he had
the opportunity without much contradiction or noyſe to
ſteale and convey himſelfe into that <hi>cathedram peſtilentiae,</hi>
that chaire of Papall ſtate, which yet he poſſeſſeth. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many other truths which were of neceſſity to be
layd a ſleep, for the paſſing of this beaſt unto his great power
and authority, and for the maintaining and ſafeguarding of
him in the poſſeſſion hereof, this is one of ſpeciall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
That Chriſtians may lawfully in a lawfull way, ſtand up
to defend themſelves, in caſe they be able, againſt any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52023:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſſaults; by what aſſailants, or by what pretended autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſoever made upon them. For had this opinion beene ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meouſly
enough, and ſubſtantially taught in the Church, it
would certainly have cauſed an abortion in Antichriſts birth,
and ſo have diſappoynted the Devill of his firſt borne. Had
not the ſpirits, and judgments and conſciences of men beene
as it were cowed and marvailouſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

exceſſively advancing the power of ſuperiors, over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors,
and binding Iron yokes and heavy burdens upon thoſe

bowed downe their backs ſo low, as to let ſuch a beaſt over
them, they would never have reſigned up their judgments
and conſciences into the hands of ſuch a ſpirituall Tyrant as
he. So that you ſee, there was a ſpeciall neceſſity for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Antichriſt into the world, yea and for the continuance
of him in his throane, that no ſuch opinion as this which wee
ſpeake of, whether truth or untruth, ſhould be taught and

neere, there is a kind of neceſſity, that thoſe truths which
have ſlept for many yeares, ſhould now be awakened; and
particularly that God ſhould reveale and diſcover unto his
faithfull Miniſters, and other his ſervants the juſt bounds and
limits of authority and power, and conſequently the juſt and
full extent of the lawfull liberties of thoſe that live in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

to ruine Antichriſt; for the Kings will never be perſwaded to

the ſinnes of wicked men: Bleſſe me O Lord from being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument

way, not to doe evill that good may come of it. The Apoſtle
forbids it, and the reaſon may be this, God hath no need of the

God elſe would not be true? <hi>Babylon</hi> will certainly fall, though

O yee Kings, and underſtand, learne yee that be Judges of

you have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked

As in marriage, ſo in monarchy there are two parties in the
contract; though without a mutuall agreement there could be no
covenant, yet after it is once made the diſſent of the inferiour
party, let it be not upon fancyed, but reall diſcontents, cannot
diſſolve the compact. Conſent therefore joynd man and wife,
King and people, but divine ordinance continues this union;
marriages and governments both are ratified in heaven. <hi>Quae
Deus conjunxit, homo ne ſeparet,</hi> whom God hath joyned, let
not man put aſunder; They muſt take their King for better for
worſe. It is very obſervable though it was permitted to the
man in ſome caſes, to give a bill of divorce, yet this licence was
never allowed to women; ſo fathers might abdicate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
not they their fathers, women cannot unmarry, nor the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52023:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>

if the caſe be ſo, it is good not to marry, it is good to
live without a King; they ought to conſider that God is wiſer
then they, and beſt knowes how to order things for the good
of mankind.</p>
               <p>That I may (if it be poſſible) undeceave the miſled multitude;
I ſhall grant if a people chooſe one man, and beſtow the name
of King upon him, yet if they retaine the ſupreame power in
themſelves, and expreſſe it by making a law that in caſe he ſhall
do ſuch and ſuch things, he ſhall forfeit his right to governe,
then it is very lawfull to depoſe him upon breach of ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For then this ſtate is a Democracy, and the legall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is in the people. Such a caſe is very poſſible, for if the royall
line in any Kingdome ſhould faile, &amp; there want one deſcended
from his loynes to ſit upon the throan, then, as a woman after
the death of her husband is free to marry to whom ſhe will in
the Lord, ſo the people may make what government they
pleaſe, they may call one King, and place their Ephori or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchi
and tribunes over him. It is not materiall that this is not
ſo wiſe a government, for it is not prudence, but ſuch a conſent,
not the underſtanding, but the will of the people that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

is no inlargement of right, but only a continuance of
that which the firſt had; elective Kingdomes are not forfeitable,
except there be ſome expreſſe law, which places a power in
the people to rule their King, and governe their governour. It

and ſucceſſive Kingdomes, if there be any ſuch expreſſe law
are forfeitable; it is as plaine, the Spartan Kings, who were hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,

and ſcorn'd, in order to be made glorious, and that they
endeavoured to kill him in order to his preſervation. So at
<hi>Edge-hill,</hi> but before they were more cruell, and reſerved for
him ſomething worſe then death, to live under their command;
<hi>Inſtrumentum ſervitutis, haberent Regem,</hi> they would make
him the unhappy inſtrument, to raiſe them to honours in the
ruine of his good Subjects. The Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> invaded
<hi>England</hi> with a potent Army, and made himſelfe King; what
our Lawes were under the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> (by whom wee
were likewiſe conquered) doth not much concerne us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
(no more indeed then it doth to know the ancient <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Lawes and Priviledges, which were taken away by them,
and the true owners were beaten out of their rightfull poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and inheritances) for he inverted the Government, altered
the Lawes, diſpoſed of Poſſeſſions to his <hi>Norman</hi> followers,
(whoſe bloud runnes in the veines of our moſt ancient Gentry)
and made all, as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as his native Subjects, feudaries
to him, ſo that he remained <hi>Directus dominus, Lord Paramont,</hi>
or <hi>overlord</hi> in the whole Land; that we may make no ſcruple
of this truth, the Lawes given us by him, and which we are to
live by now, are written in his language. However we ſtate
his entrance, whither by the ſword, or to avoid the envy of
that title, by a voluntary ſubmiſſion of all to him, as to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne;
the concluſion cannot vary, becauſe the duty of <hi>non-reſiſtance</hi>
ariſes from their owne act, they taking an oath to be
his true and loyall Subjects. It is objected, <hi>If he came in by

their conſent to be his faithfull Subjects, and to be peaceably go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by ſuch Lawes, as he ſhall, or hath given them: This
ſubſequent Act gives him a full right to the Crowne. To ſpeak
to the preſent caſe, he for his owne ſecurity, and becauſe it was
the neceſſary meanes to enable him to protect his Subjects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the right to diſpoſe the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52023:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continued in his Succeſſours even to this day (though now vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
invaded by Subjects through vertue of an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> of
which no times can afford a preſident) and all Subjects of what
condition ſoever, were bound to doe <hi>homage,</hi> and beare <hi>fealty</hi>
to him, which was inconſiſtent with taking up Armes againſt
him. That he might ſweeten their ſubjection, <hi>Quaedam jura

ſome liberties &amp; ſome priviledges upon the people (who
commonly <hi>nec totam ſervitutem pati poſſunt, nec totam liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem)</hi>
and theſe Acts of Grace he confirmes unto them by ſuch
ſecurity as ſhould not endanger his perſon nor regall authority,
that is, by promiſe and oath, and not by giving to his Subjects
legall power to un king him, if he ſhould not performe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
knowing full well, that though hee ſhould not really
breake it, yet a pretence he did ſo, might upon the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
create a civill warre; (and therefore his Subjects had as
little reaſon to accept, as he to offer ſo pernitious ſecurity, as
would put both parties in farre worſe condition) for if Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
ſhould be allowed in any caſe, that caſe would be alwayes
pretended, and though the Prince were juſt, and wiſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
yet ambitious men to compaſſe their owne ends, would
impute to him oppreſſion, weakeneſſe, and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his exemplary practiſe in his publique devotions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he did but handſomely diſſemble, and favoured a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in his heart.</p>
               <p>The method of that Rebellion in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, which made <hi>France</hi> extreamely miſerable, is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.
A factious party of the Nobility and Gentry, a ſeditious
party of the Clergy, and an unfortunate party of the ſeduced
Commonalty, entred into a <hi>holy league</hi> againſt their lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
upon pretence he was miſ-led by evill Counſellors,
and favoured the reformed doctrine, notwithſtanding he was
even ſuperſtitiouſly ſtrict in his devotions, in conformity to
what the <hi>Roman</hi> Church enjoyned. When potent Armies
were raiſed, ready to ſwallow him up, yet out of a vehement
deſire to undeceive his people, and to diſcover to the whole
world the ungrounded malice of his adverſaries in ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52023:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imputations, he refuſed the honeſt aſſiſtance of faithfull
Subjects, becauſe Proteſtants, to his owne and their probable
deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Many of King <hi>Williams</hi> Succeſſors did inlarge the Subjects
Priviledges by divers Acts of Grace, which they ſwore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but never gave them ſuch ſecurity as ſhould alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Monarchy, by granting authority to their Subjects to
force them to obſerve promiſes, and to make ſatisfaction for
<hi>true</hi> or <hi>fancyed</hi> violations.</p>
               <p>Hence it appeares, that the originall was conqueſt (as it is of
almoſt all the Kingdomes in the world) which occaſionally
conveyed to him full right, becauſe they yeilded themſelves,
and conſequently what they had to the Victor; the Lawes
which he or after Princes made for the benefit of the Subject,
were ſeverall limitations of this right, and therefore where
Lawes cannot be produced to the contrary, there the Kings
power is abſolute, and no ſpeciall caſes can be determined by
the Subject to the Kings diſadvantage. The moderation of his
power was by his owne compact, which he could not violate
without injuſtice, yet the breach of it could not indanger his
perſonall ſafety, becauſe he gave no juriſdiction to his Subjects
to force him by ſtrong hand to doe them right; and if he had
done ſo, he had made himſelfe in ſuch caſes their ſubject. What
ever we can claime as due now, is by vertue of the Kings grant,
and therefore it is ſaid by <hi>Hen.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in his ratification of the
great Charter, <hi>We have granted and given to all the free men of
our Realme theſe liberties. 9. H.</hi> 3. The whole Land was the
Conquerours, he gave part of it as a reward for their ſervice to
his <hi>Normans,</hi> and other parts to the ancient Inhabitants, and
their heires after them, yet ſo as he altered the tenure, and made
it deſcend with ſuch burdens, as he pleaſed to lay upon them:
They hold them but in <hi>fee,</hi> and therefore are bound to certaine
ſervices, and to doe ſuch and ſuch duties upon paine of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
in caſe of Treaſon and Rebellion their lands are his owne
againe, and returne into his diſpoſall. If Subjects breake their
Covenant and prove diſloyall, all their rights are forfeited by
expreſſe Law; if Kings breake their compact, no forfeiture
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52023:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
followes: The reaſon of this inequality is, becauſe the King
gave Law to the Subject, the Subject did not give Law to
him.</p>

(for he might have rooted us out for his better ſecurity, and

onely not impoſſible, that is, a moſt extreamely improbable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For it is an unheard of madneſſe, that a King ſhould
be ſuch an enemy to his owne intereſts; It is in our power to
kill our ſelves, and yet we are not affraid of our ſelves, becauſe
there is a naturall deareneſſe implanted in us, which ſecures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one from ſelfe-wrong: we have as little cauſe to be
troubled, that it is in his power to make himſelfe no King, by
deſtroying his Subjects; The <hi>King</hi> periſhes in the ruine of his
people, and the <hi>man</hi> onely ſurvives, expoſed to the hatred and
ſcorne, and revenge of mankinde. <hi>Sint quibus imperes,</hi> is a

policy can give an abſolute ſecurity; we muſt truſt ſome body,
by which a way lyes open to a poſſible miſchiefe, but many
moſt probable and certaine inconveniences are thereby avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Thirdly, we have good grounds to rely upon divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
if we doe our duty; for the hearts of Kings are in the

But though nature doth not forbid it, yet the Goſpell doth,
as it reſtraines us of many innocent delights, if we meaſure them
onely by naturall right. Private revenge is unanſwerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited

conſequence infirme, becauſe we do not love him above our
ſelves, though We part with our lives, rather then deſtroy his;
For we ſhall thereby gaine eternall life, if we doe not contrary to
the rules of charity, cut him off in his ſinne, which will certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
damne him. If any make ſcruple, that themſelves are ſinners
too, and ſo unprepared to dye, and therefore (as good reaſon
they have) they may refuſe to be damned, onely to leave their
enemy in a poſſibility of being ſaved. Theſe feares may eaſily be
ſolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Greater charity then this hath no man, then to lay down
his life for his enemy, and it were very ſtrange, if men ſhould go
to hell with as great charity, as the higheſt Saints are rewarded
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52023:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with heaven for. Perfect charity is the fulfilling of the law, and
as effectuall as univerſall obedience to Chriſts praecepts, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Goſpell. To reſigne our lives, (that is, the capacity
of ſerving God longer) out of conſcience to obey him though
againſt the ſtrongeſt temptation, is ſuch an heroicall act, that the
excellency of it, may ſupply the want of duration. It is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
ſigne of hearty repentance, and a moſt certaine argument of
our ſerious turning from all ſinne. For here is not onely godly
ſorrow for offences paſt, which is the doore and entrance into
Chriſtianity, but the perfection of it alſo, amendment of life,
which is true repentance. For we ſacrifice the pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of this world, and what ever was deare unto us, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
carnall, nay we yeild up life it ſelfe againſt the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
aſſault, the fleſh can make, to the will of God, who aſſures
that to dye thus, is gaine, as alſo, whoſoever will ſave his life,
ſhall looſe it, and whoſoever will looſe his life for my ſake, ſhall
finde it. For theſe reaſons private revenge is unlawfull though
upon private men, and therefore much more hath Chriſt diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us, from recompencing evill to the Magiſtrate, becauſe
there is ſome equality betweene mine and my neighbours life,
but publique tranquillity, the common peace of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(which is deſtroyed by civill warre) and the life of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man, though innocent, are very unequall. Naturally we love
ſociety below our ſelves, for the end of it was to convey to us
ſuch and ſuch goods, and that which is loved in order to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, is leſſe amiable; But morally and in Chriſtianity we
are bound to preferre the publique good to whatever private
Intereſt. And the obligation is very reaſonable; For if we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nature to religion, and be content to looſe our lives for the
preſent, we ſhall receive them hereafter with great advantage.
So that charity to our neighbour and love of our ſelves doe
ſweetly kiſſe each other.</p>

this is clearely their caſe, for they goe the deſtructive way, and
would root out part of the eſtabliſhed worſhip, though very
much hath beene indulged to tender conſciences even in this

conſequently againſt divine ordinance to take up armes againſt
their King, though he ſhould really favour another Religion,
and countenance by his practice ſuperſtitious rites; nay,
though the profeſſors of the true and ſetled religion ſhould be
illegally grieved. Here were an opportunity to ſhew their

humility, and patience, and not to contradict their calling, and
diſcredit the croſſe of our Saviour by taking up carnall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.
I wiſh from my ſoule, all ſuch as pretend to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Proteſtant Religion, had beene unblamable in this reſpect,

their martiall ſpirit. Wherever armes have beene lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their lawfull Magiſtrates, though they were unjuſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for the teſtimony of a good conſcience, I cannot excuſe
them from reſiſting the ordinance of God, who would have
beene glorified in their martyrdome. I am ſorry to meet with
objections drawne from the unwarrantable practiſe of ſome,
which doe not conclude you innocent, but that others were
likewiſe faulty. I am certaine the primitive Chriſtians were
better catechiſed, and wee read the ſame doctrine of true pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in their lives as in their ſchooles, which taught them to
take up Chriſts croſſe, and to follow him in that yoak in which
he drew; They fought not againſt their Arrian Emperours in
defence of the Nicene Creed; no rebellion was undertaken by
them under colour of preventing their conſciences from being
forced: which is indeed an impoſſible thing; we may be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of our goods, we cannot be plundered of our religion. Did
not Chriſtianity thrive upon perſecutions? <hi>Sanguis martyrum,
ſemen eccleſiae,</hi> The bloud of the Saints made their ſurviving
brethren fruitfull in good workes. Their patience wearied the

is this, (I will deliver the words of one of them, who hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
it the moſt fully)</hi> As it is a Parliament, it is the higheſt
Court of Juſtice in the Kingdome, therefore hath power to ſend
for by force, thoſe that are accuſed before them, that they may
come to their triall, which (if I miſtake not) power inferior
Courts have, much more the higheſt. 'Tis out of doubt agreed on
by all, that the Parliament hath a power to ſend a Serjeant at
Armes to bring up ſuch an one as is accuſed before them, and if
they have power to ſend one Serjeant at Armes, then twenty, if
twenty be accuſed, and then a hundred, then a thouſand, then ten
thouſand, if ten thouſand be accuſed, and ſo more or leſſe as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſerves; for there is the ſame reaſon for two as for one, for a
hundred as for twenty, for a thouſand as for a hundred, and take
away this power from the Parliament, and 'tis no longer a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the King and His Forefathers have by Law ſetled
theſe Liberties of Parliament, and therefore according to Lawes
they have ae power to ſend for by force thoſe that are accuſed to be
tryed before them, which they cannot doe, unleſſe they raiſe an
Army, when the accuſed are kept from them by an Army. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

by ſpeciall priviledge for it's better regulation, power over
it's owne members, to impriſon or turne out, and this power
though at any time abuſed againſt juſtice and equity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truſt repoſed in them, both by King and people (as
if men ſhould be committed for delivering their opinions freely
becauſe their reaſon was not ſo happy as to concurre with the

major part; or if ſome ſhould be <hi>accuſed</hi> and others <hi>paſt by,</hi>

made the meaſure of right &amp; wrong) yet this miſuſed authority
hath the effects of juſtice and right, &amp; makes the act legally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
But the Houſe of Commons hath no juriſdiction over thoſe
who are without, except at moſt in caſe of breach of Priviledge;
it cannot judge or condemne any, no not ſo much as examine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oath: ſo that the argument is, the Parliament, that is the Houſe
of Lords, as the higheſt Court of juſtice, may legally raiſe an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
without the conſent, nay againſt the command of the King, it
concludes too without the conſent, and if they pleaſe, againſt the
expreſſe will of the Commons declared to the contrary. This
doctrine once ſince this Parliament ſate, would not have been ſo
pleaſing to the lower Houſe, that they would have taken care
for printing it by Order from their Committee. There was a
time when one of this Houſe profeſſed openly, he hoped to ſee
that skie fall too, and the Lords were put in minde, they ſate but
in perſonall capacities (whereas Knights were ſhires, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
were townes and Cities) and therefore it was thought fit
to give them warning and to admoniſh them to take heed how
they thwarted the repreſentative Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the ſame reaſon Judges of inferiour Courts, out
of Parliament at leaſt, may raiſe an army to fetch in delinquents;
if the framers of this objection, had conſulted with thoſe Sages,
they would have better inſtructed them in the lawes. In caſes of
ſuch high conſequences, it was the cuſtome of the Houſe of
Peeres to adviſe with theſe Oracles, to take directions from
them, at leaſt to know their opinion and the reaſons of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had employed their whole time and ſtudies to finde
out the true meaning of the lawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, To diſcover their miſtake and the inconſequence
of the argument,</hi> There is the ſame reaſon for twenty as for one,
and ſo for an hundred, for a thouſand, for an army, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is not the ſame; becauſe when a few are ſent out,
the adminiſtration of juſtice doth not indanger the common
peace. But becauſe a warre doth put the whole Kingdome in
manifeſt perill of being ruined, therefore when either reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
or pretended to be ſo, are ſo many, as to make the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
doubtfull, the liberty and right of inferiour Magiſtrates to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52023:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fetch them in by force, is in this caſe reſtrained by expreſſe lawes,
which provides very prudently, that no warre ſhall be made, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
authorized by the ſupreame governour. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the lawes permit the King to pardon all offences againſt his
crowne and dignity, ſuppoſing he will doe it, as ſometimes out
of goodneſſe of nature, ſo ſometimes out of the ſtrength of his
underſtanding, becauſe not mercy only, but wiſedome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

by Judges of inferiour Courts, and ordinary Juſtices, to
force delinquents to appearance (though their crime ought
to be ſpecified, for to call them malignants or delinquents, is no
legall charge) if they be not ſo many, as that they make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
as cannot be puniſhed without an Army; for a civill
warre endangers all, and begets more faults then it puniſhes, and
therefore the lawes referre the ordering of the common-wealth

               <p>Many ridiculous conſequences flow from hence, but I liſt
not to make ſport with that unhappy diſtinction which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ruined as flouriſhing and ſtrongly temperd a Kingdome as
any in the Chriſtian world. It expoſes Magiſtrates, and all in
authority to the contempt and injuries of the baſer ſort of
people. For when diſcontented, it is very obvious for them to
tell them a reverence is indeed due to their function, &amp; therfore
that they ſetting their <hi>office</hi> aſide, will take liberty only to kick
their <hi>perſons,</hi> and that the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is not at all affronted,
though the <hi>man</hi> be ſoundly beaten. It is againſt common ſenſe
to put ſuch a difference betweene the <hi>perſon</hi> and the <hi>authority</hi>
of the King, for if it were reall, neither God, nor the Lawes of
the Land have made any proviſion for the Kings ſafety; for His
authority is not capable of receiving any benefit, and therefore
it muſt be acknowledged by all ſober and reaſonable men, that
His authority doth but convey ſuch and ſuch priviledges upon
the perſon, who onely can be ſenſible of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
whatever is attempted againſt his perſon, is attempted
againſt his authority likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Another cavill is taken from theſe words in <hi>Rom. 13. For
Rulers are not a terror to good workes, but to the evill; wilt thou
then not be afrayd of the power, doe that which is good, and thou
ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame. For he is the miniſter of God to
thee for good.</hi> Their Argument is framed thus. A Magiſtrate is
the Miniſter of God for our good, therefore he which is not a
Miniſter for our good, is no Magiſtrate, and to reſiſt him, is not
to reſiſt the ordinance of God, (which inſtituted Rulers for the
peoples happineſſe) but the faults and exorbitances of men,
which endeavour to rob them of the bleſſings of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
orderly government, and to make them bow downe
under the heavy burdens of an arbitrary ſway. Their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52023:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(contradictory in it ſelfe) is plainly this, A bad Magiſtrate
is no Magiſtrate, (as being a terror to good works, and giving
praiſe to the evill, contrary to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> definition of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,)
and therefore no honour is due to him, no reſiſtance is
forbidden.</p>

Experience ſhewes, that Kingdomes ſuffer infinitely more by

wee ſhall find, though he did injure ſome particulars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
to ſome inordinate affections againſt the tenor of Law,
yet juſtice was favoured in the generall, and the greateſt part of
the Kingdome reaped the fruits of order. Whereas illegall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

all law and juſtice, and the Subjects will be plundered more

people, though oppreſſed, to ſubmit with patience even to a

and prevaile, he may be tempred (as highly provoked) to rule
them with a rod of iron, and to provide for future ſafety, by
utter diſabling them to hurt him: but if they get the better,

Rights and Prerogative. So that <hi>England</hi> would be the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſcene, where the tragedies of <hi>Germany</hi> would be reacted.
But grant a totall extirpation, and that they ſhall be able to go
through with their wicked deſigne, and not only <hi>branch,</hi> but
even <hi>root</hi> Monarchy alſo (for this is aimed at by ſome, who feare
it may ſprout againe, if the ſtock be left) have wee yet at laſt
any hopes of peace, when wee are ſo undone by warre, that
wee have nothing left to looſe but our lives? truely no, then
like theeves, when once ſecure of their booty, we ſhould have
thouſand differences in dividing the prey, all of them challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
preferments great as their ſinnes, and ſetting ſuch a price
upon their wickedneſſe, as the eſtates of all honeſt men will
not be able to pay; it is not poſſible, what they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
can be pleaſant to them, when they conſider much more
might be enjoyed, and ſadly recollect the inequality of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
to the adventure; for their lives were expoſed to
the danger of the law, their reputation is loſt with all good
men, and their ſoules are eternally ruin'd. They would fall out
amongſt themſelves, who was the greateſt Traytor, and
never yeild precedency in miſchiefes, becauſe that is the
meaſure of Sharing. Some would plead, they <hi>contrived,</hi> others,
they <hi>acted</hi> the Treaſon, and thinke a ſubtile braine ſhould have
no priviledge above a couragious heart, it being more eaſie to
fright the people by inventing falſe dangers, then to lead them
on, and make them ſtand the brunt of true. It is beyond my
skill to proportion the wages of ſin, &amp; determine, whether the
<hi>ſlye</hi> and <hi>cunning ſetter</hi> or the <hi>ſtout thief</hi> can claim greateſt ſhare
in the ſpoyle. But commonly the ſpeculatively malicious men
are miſerably deceived of their expected requitall. For though
they ſet the miſchiefes on foot, yet their journey-men, quickly
apprehending the myſtery, are eaſily tempted to ſet up for
themſelves. It hath beene often ſeene, that to end ſuch quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells,
he that was head of the conſpiracy in reference to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52023:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
part of it, and who had force enough to oppreſſe a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
would uſe the ſame to eſtablish himſelfe their Lord and
Maſter, and his government was ſo much the more rigid, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and miſerable, becauſe he was frighted with his owne
example upon his predeceſſor.</p>
               <p>This I conceive to be the Apoſtles ſenſe, that wee muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
even to bad Governours (ſuch they were when he wrote
this Epiſtle) not only out of honeſty, but prudence alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if wee goe about to make them better, wee ſhall put the
Kingdome, and conſequently our ſelves, in farre worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>After this explanation, I will reduce their Argument into
forme, that I may thereby give more diſtinct ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Non reſiſtance is forbidden only to the powers ordained
of God;</p>
               <p>But powers uſed tyrannically are not ordained of God,
therefore wee are not forbidden to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is abſolutely falſe: For though tyranny be not
the ordinance of God, yet the power (which is commanded to
rule juſtly, but withall inabled to doe otherwiſe, for the uſe
is left indifferent in reſpect not of the Magiſtrates, but Subjects
duty, ſo that abuſe doth not voyd authority, when ſwerving
from lawes) is of divine conſtitution. The obligation not to
reſiſt ſuperiour powers receives not ſtrength from mans juſtice,
nor is it weakned or made null by injuſtice. <hi>Saul</hi> was Gods
anoynted, and <hi>Pilate</hi> had authority from Heaven, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the extreame abuſe of it. Had the Apoſtle meant as they
endeavour to perſwade the world, conſidering what Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
the Chriſtians then lived under, he had laid downe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of rebellion, whereas he labours to teach them patience.</p>
               <p>Thus much in anſwer to their objections againſt what was
delivered in the ſecond Section; I ſhall now examine their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
againſt what was aſſumed in the precedent Section,</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52023:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that by this name can only be meant, a reſtrained and
limited Monarchy, that is, that ſuch a King, though he have
Supreme, yet hath not abſolute power. By reaſon of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
from his owne grant and poſitive conſtitutions, active
obedience is not due to his illegall commands, and by reaſon of
his ſupreme power and ſole right to make Warre and Peace,
paſſive obedience is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Monarchy compounded of three coordinate Eſtates, in plaine
Engliſh, ſpeaks this nonſenſe, the power which one only hath,
is in three joyntly and equally.</p>
               <p>The ground of this invention, and ſo much fancyed coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which our ancient Lawyers never dreamt of, may be
this. If they meane by it, that the conſent of all three Eſtates
(I will not alter the new manner of expreſſing this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only take notice by the way, that heretofore, the
Parliament was taken for an Aſſembly of the King and the three
Eſtates, and that in all other Kingdomes likewiſe there are
three States, the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Commonalty,
diſtinct from the Head) are equally required for tranſacting
ſuch buſineſſes as the King hath obliged himſelfe not to doe
without them and that they have the right of a negative voice,
wee ſhall indulge to them the name of <hi>coordination</hi> to two pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
which are, making new, repealing old lawes, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the Kings neceſſities, in ſuch proportion as they ſhall
think fitting. Theſe are great democraticall advantages, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
no authority of making hoſtile reſiſtance againſt their
ſoveraign, in caſe he ſhould do contrary to the eſtabliſhed laws,
Theſe are ſtill in force, till abrogated by joynt conſent, and
bind his conſcience, but he cannot be forced to put them in
execution, becauſe he hath no ſuperior in juriſdiction; and he
hath no equall in managing <hi>jus gladii,</hi> the materiall ſword,
which is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh their reſiſtance from rebellion,
and give it the title of a juſt warre. For except they can prove
themſelves not be His Subjects, I am forced to tell them, if they
fight againſt him, they are by the law of Nations and of this
land worthily reputed Rebells, and by divine law they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of damnation.</p>

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:52023:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus therefore; the two Houſes, or two Eſtates of Lords and
Commons, are not bound to ſubmit their conſent to the Kings
command in matter of Subſidy, or taking away any ancient
Law, if they conceive it diſadvantageous to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
<hi>Par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> in thoſe things in
which they are equall, as a rather and a ſonne being joyned in
commiſſion; in this ſenſe let them be called coordinate. Yet
they are ſubject in all other things, and therefore may not take
up armes without his conſent, for this is deſtructive of their
alleagiance.</p>
               <p>If there be a <hi>Coordination</hi> in the ſupremacy, that is, if the King
and Lords and Commons are joyntly the ſupreme governour,
the <hi>Correlatum</hi> is wanting, none are left over whom they
ſhould Reigne, wee ſhould have a Kingdome without a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
becauſe all may challenge a ſhare in ſoveraignty.</p>
               <p>The Parliament not ſitting, they will not deny the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to be ſolely in the King, and certainly by calling His great
Councell together, he doth not empty himſelfe of any regall
power; it were very ſtrange our lawes ſhould be guilty of ſuch
vanity to make a uſeleſſe coordination, for if His rivalls ſhould
make any attempts upon His Prerogatives, He can legally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
them, (except when he hath paſt a particular grant for
their continuance, and then the enlargement of their time of
ſetting, doth not enlarge their power) and after He hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
the Aſſembly, (as the right to doe ſo is unqueſtionable)
then He is Supreme againe, none being left to ſtand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.
The cleare buſineſſe is this, all markes of ſupremacy are
in the King, nor is it any Argument of communicating His
power, that He reſtraines Himſelfe from exerciſing ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
acts without conſent of Parliament, for it is by vertue of
His owne grant, that ſuch after acts ſhall not be valid. He hath
not divided His legiſlative faculty, but tyed Himſelfe from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it, except by the advice and conſent of the Peeres, and at
the requeſt of the Commons, their rogation muſt precede His
ratification. I ſhewed this in the Roman Empire likewiſe, and
yet none fancyed, an equality between Subjects and the King
or Emperour was thereby introduced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:52023:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As the <hi>houtefeus</hi> of <hi>France</hi> argued from the denomination of
<hi>Pares Franciae,</hi> to make them equall with the King, ſo our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries
from <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Comites,</hi> to bring in a <hi>coordination</hi>
whereas it is evident that Peeres, referres not to the King, but
ſignifies (as the Perſian <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> mentioned in <hi>Zenophon)</hi> Subjects
in the ſame ranke of honour, and enjoying equall priviledges, one
is another. And to make <hi>Comites</hi> is called by <hi>Lampridius in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubernium

them from having that ſpeciall honour to be <hi>in comitatu regis,
Suetonius</hi> calls them <hi>comites peregrinationum, expeditionumque

councellours, but created by the Emperour, the fountaine of all
honour, and ſo not <hi>ſimiles altiſſimo,</hi> equall to him, though exalted
above fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>The briefe is, the frame of governement, as it is eſtabliſhed by
our lawes, clearely condemnes their undertakings, and therefore
they have laid ſuch a foundation, as will ſupport the building.
For if they can but prove that Parliament men, and thoſe who
are ſtirred up to fight againſt their Soveraigne, are not the Kings
Subjects, they have acquitted them from being Rebells.</p>
               <p>We have ſeene the ground worke, and ſhall now take the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure
into due conſideration; the whole fabrick is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in that exiome ſo frequently applied to juſtifie all illegall
proceedings. <hi>Coordinata ſe invicem ſupplent, Coordinates ought
mutually to ſupply each others failing,</hi> that we may not ſuffer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by neceſſary or voluntary defects, and that the Kingdome
may not runne the hazard of being ruined for want of ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
lawes, and therefore when the King is perverſe and
will not joyne with them for the common good, they have full
authority without him.</p>
               <p>This would conclude as ſtrongly for the power of enacting
lawes without the King, which the Houſes have diſclaimed. It
is true, this legiſlative authority is exerciſed under another name,
let the Authors anſwer for practiſing what themſelves have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
diſallowed. For it is but ſmall ſatisfaction to the injur'd
Subject, to tell them they challenge not a power to make ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52023:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lawes, but onely temporary Ordinances: That is, they will
take away their eſtates for the preſent, and then their votes ſhall
be no longer binding, was not this the reaſon why ſuch Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
are juſtly accompted grievances, as doe intrench upon
the Subjects liberties or property? The Subjects are equally
miſerable, whither their birthright, the lawes of this land, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne
by Royall Proclamations or Ordinances of one or
both Houſes.</p>
               <p>Coordinata ſe invicem ſupplent, Coordinates ſupply each others
failings; therefore if one refuſe, the other two are enabled to doe it
without him.</p>
               <p>By the ſame logique, if the King and Houſe of Lords joyne,
the conſent of the Houſe of Commons is legally ſupplied, and
they may conſtitute what they pleaſe without them. This is
the evident doctrine of it, which yet is commanded by the Houſe
to be printed. If the King had ſayd this, it had beene the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
breach of Parliamentary priviledges that ever had beene
made. Poſterity will have no reaſon to be thankefull to them
for diſputing themſelves out of the right of a negative voyce,
onely that they may with ſome ſmall colour (making uſe of an
accidentall advantage, the major part of thoſe few Lords, which
remaine in the Houſe now, joyning with them) take away
from the King (what is as much his by law as the crowne he
weares) his right to reject any Bill, never queſtioned by our
Anceſtors, and it is very ſtrange it ſhould now; Sir <hi>Thomas

the ſame with the publique. The greateſt ſecurity the
Subject hath, that equall lawes ſhall be preſerved, is from his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
voyce. The intereſts of the major part in the Houſe of
Commons may be oppoſite to the good of the Kingdome in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.
For if we reckon thoſe many that ſerve for, and are (or
would be, in future elections, if the power were thus enabled to
effect what ever advantageous deſignes) of Corporations, and
thoſe few in compariſon, who ſerve for Shires, we ſhall eaſily
beleeve, the priviledges of Cities and Townes, may be inlarged
by them to the great diſcouragement and loſſe of the honeſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and painefull husbandman; So the Burgeſſes for the Weſt
are ſo many, that upon an unanimous conſpiracy amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and labouring ſome ſingle perſons, who may be eaſily
wonne out of relation of acquaintance, friends, or kinſmen, or
their inadvertency, and not fully weighing, or not underſtanding
the conſequences of it, they may eaſily carry by vote, what is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beneficiall to themſelves, though extreamely prejudiciall to
the other parts of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>To goe higher, it is very eaſy to conceive, that the major part
of the lower Houſe, may be very meane men choſen to make
more profitable lawes for the poorer ſort, and to keepe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
under by laying ſubſidies and all burdens of the Common-wealth
upon them, not without a ſpecious pretence, that they
ſpend more in ſuperfluities then would diſcharge all publique
expenſes, and exempting themſelves from all payments, as being
ſuch, who take great paines, and worke very hard, even for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
The poſſibility of ſuch a choiſe is apparent, becauſe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideriug
how ſmall meanes are required to a capacity of voting
in the election of Parliament men (it may perhaps be more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ordered hereafter by the wiſedome of that great Court, who
may thinke it fit to raiſe 40<hi rend="sup">l</hi> 
                  <hi>per annum</hi> freehold to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as that eſtate was valuable at, in the firſt conſtitution,
when the ſcarcity of money made it a competent fortune) the
greater part of thoſe which chooſe them are poore contry-men
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52023:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and beggarly tradeſmen. Such a choiſe then is very poſſible, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it improbable, if Parliaments ſhall be governed by theſe
new principles. For the reaſon why ſuch an election was never
yet made, is this, ſuch a power was never heretofore challenged,
as could enable them to goe through with any ſuch deſigne. If
either the Lords perceived any motion from the Commons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
to themſelves, or the King thought it prejudiciall
to the publique, and ſo neceſſarily unprofitable for him (as if
the merchant ſhould be diſcouraged, by laying too greatbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
upon forraigne trade, or the Clergy impoveriſhed, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away thoſe meanes which ſhould make men able, and keep
them honeſt) it was preſently rejected, and ſo not to be ſtickled
in further, ſitting that Parliament. If ſome factious ſpirits
wrought upon their diſcontents, and perſwaded them to paſſe
nothing, whether by granting ſubſidies, or conſenting to new
lawes, which might be beneficiall for the preſent State, till they
received ſatisfaction in their deſires, though ſuch a perverſneſſe
(which I ſuppoſe onely and doe not ſay it ever was) might be
very unhappy for the Kingdome (for by making the King poor,
it would probably put his friends upon ſome unwarrantable
courſes, whereby to ſupply his wants, and this would create a
miſunderſtanding betweene him and his people, and breed ill
humours, which fomented by crafty men, would breake out
in ſuch violent diſtempers, that there would be a neceſſity of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
phiſitians; Theſe politique phiſitians when once entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſuch an extremity, will be ſure ſo to manage the diſeaſe,
that they will be paied as much as they pleaſe to demand. They
will deſire ſuch offices, ſuch commands, not for themſelves, but
onely in order to the recovery of their patients; The deniall of
which ſhall put the people in danger of a relapſe, and they will
preſcribe the wayes of prevention and make uſe of the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of diſtempered men, to compaſſe their owne ends) though
I ſay, ſuch a ſullenneſſe would make the Kingdome miſerable,
yet it is their right to deny the moſt reaſonable propoſall, and
there is not any legall remedy againſt inconveniences, which
will certainely flow from hence. Neither neceſſity nor <hi>propte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52023:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
populi ſuprema lex,</hi> can enable the King juſtly to provide for
the Kingdomes ſafety, by raiſing money againſt the known
Lawes: he may in this caſe diſſolve the aſſembly, and onely uſe
ſuch meanes, as are not contrary to Law. By reaſon of theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
voices, and the Kings right, as to call together, ſo to
breake up that great councell, there was not any hope of new
moulding this State to particular Intereſſes, and therefore theſe
unequall compoſitions of the Houſe of Commons had no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the diſadvantage of the Commonwealth. Yet now wee
may probably ſuffer under them, if this new doctrine take place,
That the Kings conſent is paſt, and involved in the Lords and
Commons; for the next rub of the Lords negative is remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the ſame Logicke of <hi>Coordinata ſe ſupplent,</hi> and that the
people may not periſh for defect of a ſupplementall Law; it was
eſſayed formerly, that they ſitting in perſonall capacities, ſhould
not oppoſe what conduced to the ſafety of the Kingdome, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the Commons, and thoſe two grounds being laid, as
the King and Lords are voted out of Parliament, ſo it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
the Gentry would be but very thinne in the Houſe of
Commons, upon new election hereafter, becauſe the diſpoſall of
all would be put into their hands, whoſe intereſts are moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from the publique tranquility, as enjoying leaſt by the
preſent eſtabliſhment in this State. From hence it is apparent,
what confuſion were likely to follow, and the ſhort experience
we have had, hath already too fully acquainted us with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
conſequences.</p>
               <p>To anſwer diſtinctly to their axiome coordinates ſupply each
others failing; if it ſhould be underſtood in that ſenſe, which
they plead for, that the King failing to performe his duty, the
Lords and Commons are enabled to tranſact buſineſſes without
him by vertue of this rule, upon the very ſame grounds the
King and Houſe of Commons may exclude the Lords, the
King and Lords may exclude the Commons; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſtructive of the fundamentall priviledge and right
of either Houſe this onely can be meant by it in the preſent caſe,
that the power of any one or two of them, is defective to ſome
purpoſes expreſſely named in our lawes, (as for enacting new
lawes, or raiſing money upon the Subject) without a joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all three. This interpretation is very reaſonable, but it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52023:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concludes againſt them, and forthe King; for he requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but (what our Lawes grant him, and what he alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
equally their due) a right to a negative voice in
thoſe things to which the three eſtates are coordinate. The uſe
of it cannot be injurious, for a deniall to bring in a new governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

the two Houſes are greater then the King.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is granted, becauſe Parliament includes King

a Kingdome without any King.</p>

                  </label> The want of Logique hath proved as fatall to this Kingdome, as the want of conſcience; I cannot determine which hath had the ſtrongeſt influence in our calamities, the malice of ſome, or
the ignorance of others. Suppoſe the Lords ſhould remove their
Houſe out of the City (as they have an undoubted right ſo to
doe, upon the agreement of the major part, and there might be
ſome motives for it, for to ſay nothing elſe, their number would
be more then doubled) where would theſe men place the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
If the King and Lords ſhould legally ſit in <hi>Oxford,</hi> were
the Houſe of Commons thereby excluded from being a part, or
could they be concluded the whole Parliament? It is not an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in reſpect of place, but an union of their aſſent and the Royall
ratification, which actuates the power into a law. The Kings
abſence doth not deſtroy the being of Parliament (no more then
if he ſhould diſſent being preſent) nor doth it forfeit his power
into their diſpoſall, as you may ſee 33. H. 8. c. 21. <hi>His aſſent by
his letters patent is and ever was of as good ſtrenght and force, as
though the Kings perſon had beene there perſonally preſent, and had
aſſented openly and publiquely to the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if he diſſent from them and refuſe to confirme their
votes? Then they ought not to have the force of lawes, no
more then if the King and Lords ſhould agree on any thing the
Commons contradicting it; neither is a legall eſtabliſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If they ſay, his obſtinate refuſall voides the Parliament, for it is
made of no uſe, if it may not be active, when deſerted by him,
and except he pleaſe to eſtabliſh their ordinances; The King
might as well preſſe the Commons to conſent to what he and
the Lords ſhall thinke fitting, becauſe otherwiſe they void the
Parliament, for it is of no uſe, if it may not be active without
their aſſent which they reſolve not to paſſe.</p>
               <p>This conſtitution of the negative voyce in either of the three

of all ſorts, and degrees of people, which is ſayd to owe
next to God a naturall and humble obedience, 24 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 12.
And it is evident, that hee is not the head of this or that man,
but of all the members in conjunction, of the whole body, for
elſe he would be the head of millions of bodies, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
have as many diſtinct Kingdoms, as particular Subjects.
It is needleſſe to multiply quotations, as the 25. <hi>H. 8. 21. This

               <p>I will ſumme up the reaſons in briefe, which prove, that the
King is not <hi>minor univerſis.</hi> Firſt, if the Houſes are above Him,
He hath no right of Empire upon them, becauſe <hi>inferior in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem
non habet imperium,</hi> but this is falſe, for they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by Law to His commands, when he bids them come,
they are bound to come; and when he bids them goe, they are
bound to go, that is when he calls them by his Writ, they ought
to attend <hi>praeſcriptis die &amp; loco,</hi> and he prorogues the aſſembly,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52023:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or diſſolves it when he thinks fitting. It is no prejudice to this
right, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to reſtraine the exerciſe of
it in this preſent Parliament without their conſent, to the end
thoſe vaſt debts which were brought upon this Kingdome
might be diſcharged, and in order to that, good ſecurity might
be given to ſuch perſons as were willing to ingage their eſtates,
for the benefit of the common-wealth. I will make no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by urging their abuſe of truſt, by which they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to take off that great burthen, which they have made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more heavy, and whereas they might in ſhort time have
eaſed this State, our debts hourely grow upon us, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
eſtates are but the fuell to feed that fire which ſenſibly
conſumes this unhappy Nation. Notwithſtanding, they have
deceived both King and people, yet His Majeſty cannot ſatisfie
Himſelfe in their Logique, and ſuffer Himſelfe to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he may lawfully reaſſume His right, becauſe they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to truſt. Though the perpetuity of this Parliament was
never intended, and it hath beene of moſt pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
yet the King will not allow Himſelfe any liberty (to
diſſolve it) againſt law, upon moſt reall good intentions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the preſident is full of danger, and though in the preſent
caſe it would be uſed for the benefit of His people, yet hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it probably might be abuſed to their greater diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the diviſion of all perſons in this Land is into King
and Subjects, liege Lord and liege people, and therefore they
muſt be placed in the latter ranke. It is a ſtrange phanſie to
abſtract the body politique from all the particulars whereof it
is compacted, and to ſalve the Oath of Allegiance, by telling
us <hi>the univerſe or body politique never ſwore alleagiance or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
to the King, neither is it poſſible it ſhould. Reply to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the obſervations, pag.</hi> 17. and again, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. (in anſwer
to the 24. <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 12. The King is ſupreme head, unto
whom a body politique compact of all ſorts and degrees of
people are bounden and owe next to God a naturall &amp; humble

doth owe obedience, but that the ſeverall ſorts and degrees of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of which this body is compacted and made, that they doe owe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52023:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obedience, for to take it otherwiſe, were to make an abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
conſtruction. &amp;c.</hi> If every particular man performe his
duty of alleagiance as he ſtands obliged by oath, let him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his met a phiſicall body to the King even as he pleaſes. If
<hi>the body politique have not ſworne allegiance or ſupremacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a body only in conſideration of law, that hath neither
life or motion, like other invidualls</hi> p. 17. and for the ſame reaſon
<hi>doth not owe homage and obedience</hi> p. 18. How is it capable of
rebelling againſt the Head? for it cannot fight but by the hands
of particular men, and all theſe are tyed up by divine law, and
their owne oathes.</p>
               <p>3. They acknowledge themſelves his ſubjects as united in
Parliament; and if they ſhould deny it, they could not challenge
any benefit from his royall protection.</p>
               <p>4. The lawes intruſt him, not the Houſes to protect us.</p>
               <p>5. The Houſes repreſent only ſubjects oppoſed to the King,
who is their ſuperiour by humane and conſequently divine law,
both as their naturall King and as Gods anoynted, his repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</p>
               <p>6. There is a great difference between the reall and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
all; for though it were true, (as it is not) that he were
leſſe then the whole people, yet this would not bring the
concluſion home to the Houſes. Who are the people only to
ſuch purpoſes as the law nominates, <hi>viz.</hi> for conſenting to
Lawes or Taxes upon the Subject. To all other purpoſes
(wherein Regall power is not expreſly limited) the
King is the whole people, and what he doth is legally their Act.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us of ſome Kings, that had as full right over their
whole realme, as a popular ſtate can have over it ſelfe, and all
things belonging thereto 3. pol. 14. To ſuch an one that of the
Tragaedian is truely and properly applyed.

to make advantage of them only in this Kingdome, yet they
conclude againſt the poſſibility of making any King abſolute,
which reaſon and experience have clearely confuſed. For a
people if conquered, (their lives and all they have being then
in the hand of the victor) or if in feare to be ſwallowed up by a
more potent enemy, they may and often have very prudently
conſented to place all the legall power of the Kingdome in one
man, that he may thereby be enabled to protect them, and
where the legiſlative power is unreſtrained, there the rule is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</p>
               <p>To apply this doctrine; In thoſe things wherein the King of
<hi>England</hi> is not abſolute, as in the exerciſe of his legiſlative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and raiſing money without conſent, The Houſes together
with him, repreſent the people; but in ſuch matters, wherein he
is abſolute, (that is, wherein he is not reſtrained by lawes which
are but limitations of Regall power) there he is <hi>Populus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanus,</hi>
legally <hi>the Engliſh Nation.</hi> For example ſake, I will
inſtance in the power of making Warre and Peace, if any take
up Armes by vertue of any other then his Commiſſion, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not the King alone, but the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> as, <hi>People</hi> is
to be underſtood in law, for their hands are tyed up, and all their
legall ſtrength is in the Kings diſpoſall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us examine their Argument,</hi> The whole people are above
their King, therefore the Houſes, becauſe they repreſent them.</p>
               <p>The Antecedent I have ſhewed falſe, becauſe the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are but ſuch a number of Subjects, who can have no colour
of pretence to be above him, whom God and the law hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
over them.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is as infirme, and the reaſon of it fallacious,
for if repreſentatives might challenge all rights appertaining to
the perſons by them repreſented, then a Jury ſhall be concluded
as honourable as the Houſe of Commons, and then too becauſe
the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> may challenge of the King of <hi>France</hi>
or <hi>England</hi> (not ſuperiority, for they are as ſupreame and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52023:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe Kings, which the Court of honour guided by the
law of nations, and reaſon would pronounce very abſurd.</p>
               <p>Againe they repreſent the people only to ſome purpoſes; to
make warre is none of them; The King alone can declare the
peoples mind in this caſe, they have no legall way of expreſſing
themſelves but in his Commiſſions, and therefore the warre is
not betweene King and People, but ſo many particular perſons
exceeding the truſt committed to them, againſt the duty of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
oppoſe both King and People. It is very remarkeable,
that in the begining of theſe unhappy contrivances, ſome mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
appearing in tumultuous wayes, what ever they deſired
or did was called the Act of the People, providing for their own
ſafety. But after the ſenſe of miſeries had bettered their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
to make them diſcerne, this unnaturall warre was not
like to improve the meanes of preſervation, many of them make
a Covenant to live peaceably and honeſtly amongſt themſelves,
ſo in <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> long ſince, and lately between <hi>Cornwall</hi> and
<hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and now the Houſes interpoſe, and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the people who were ſtirred up and encouraged to raiſe a
warre againſt law, to make a peace according to law; let them
trouble the waters as much as they pleaſe, they ſhall be borne
out in it; but they muſt not thinke of ſetling them, till they have
done fiſhing; This would be a breach of Priviledge. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are now forced to defend themſelves, and their goods vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
taken from them, for their ſecurity; who might ſoone be
happy againe, if their friends would be leſſe carefull of their
ſafety. It is well knowne who began to appeale to the People;
withall my heart (if law muſt be ſuſpended) let them arbitrate
the differences. The certaine way to know their judgement,
and whom they apprehend to be a reall defender of what both
pretend, our lawes and propertie, and liberty, and the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
religion, is to ceaſe plundering of both ſides, and leave
them to their naturall inclination. That ſide which confeſſes it
cannot ſubſiſt without uſing violence and oppreſſion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their eſtates from them, acknowledges that the people,
whom they pretend to fight for, is clearly againſt them, and
they have ſmall reaſon to challenge a priviledge of breaking all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52023:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lawes, by vertue of that <hi>paramount Law, populi ſalus,</hi> when as
their unwarrantable courſes ventured on in order to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the people, doe manifeſtly conduce (even the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Judges, and repenting their former folly) to the poverty,
ſlavery, and ruine of all.</p>
               <p>It remaines, I lay downe my promiſed concluſion of the
whole, that notwithſtanding ſuch a power of reſiſtance, as they
or any others have yet openly pleaded for, ſhould be granted
lawfull (as when in their owne defence, or when he that hath
the higheſt authority, and is bound by the Law of God and his
owne promiſe or oath, to adminiſter juſtice equally, after fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
repreſentations of their grievances, and moſt juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

               <p>The Armes taken up againſt the King, were not (as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
defenſive, nor in maintenance of any thing which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

               <p>If we call to minde that unhappy time,<note place="margin">This warre offenſive of the Subjects part.</note> when His Majeſty

render a faithfull accompt of this contempt, harder to be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
then the former popular fury, wee may perceive their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards him, was a ſufficient confutution of their
feares of him. They told the people, they were afraid of His
power, and yet anſwered their owne jealouſies by ſhewing to
the world, they were able to take it from Him; He was ſo
farre from being in a condition to invade their rights, He had
not wherewith to defend His owne. His inability to revenge
indignities was ſo notorious, they durſt be even wanton in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52023:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Him. When He wooed them in that gracious Meſſage
from <hi>Windſor,</hi> His yeelding ſo much did but tempt them to uſe
greater rigour. Nothing would ſatisfie, unleſſe he would make
their <hi>votes</hi> the meaſure of His obedience; for what priviledge
had they above private Counſellors, if their advice ſhould not
ſway with Him more then reaſon? when He requeſted them
onely to make knowne what was wanting to the Kingdomes
happineſſe, and He would chearefully ſupply it, they thinke it
loſſe of time to repreſent particular defects, but put him into
ſuch a way as will effect it, to be guided in all things as they
ſhall direct, that is, to let them manage His Royall power, who
knew better how to governe. Becauſe He will not ſubmit to
their blanke deſires, by confeſſing His <hi>Vote</hi> to be legally invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in their <hi>Orders,</hi> nor reſigne up that power which the law
hath intruſted Him with, and which cannot be ſeparated from
the Crowne without diſſolution of this government, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He is obliged both in juſtice and honour to preſerve it as
the neceſſary meanes, whereby He is inabled to protect His
people; Becauſe, I ſay, He will ſtill be King, and not part with
thoſe Rights which God and the Law gives Him, they will
diſpenſe with their duty of being Subjects, and challenge a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to take away thoſe Rights, which He will not, when
petitioned, fairely deliver. After this, he retires to <hi>Yorke,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſirous to live ſafely, and contented to ſuffer ſuch an eclypſe
of glory, till ſuch time as the abuſed people ſhould recover
their underſtandings, and theſe clouds ſhould be diſpelled by a
cleare apprehenſion of His innocence, and undeſerved ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.
Thither the ſtorme purſues Him, His Rents are ſtopped,
that He might become a burthen to the Northerne people, and
that they might be tempted to part with Him, with as much
cheerfulneſſe, as they would be rid of the poore of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Commiſſioners were pickt out, and ſent amongſt them to
incenſe the leſſe knowing, and to awe the more honeſt party,
from receiving their naked Soveraigne into their protection.
The dangers they would incurre by their perverſe loyalty are
laid open. They will certainely be Voted high Malignants, and
notorious Delinquents, if they fruſtrate the <hi>pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52023:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
injuſtice by their charity; for to what purpoſe did they
take his revenues from him, if others ſhould be allowed to give
Him ſufficient wherewith to cloth and feed Himſelfe. Though
ſuch order was taken, by ſeizing His demaines, He ſhould not
live amongſt them as a King, yet the ſweetneſſe of His private
and familiar converſation with them, made Him an extreamely
popular Gentleman. And therefore miſdoubting a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to obedience upon tryall of ſo great goodneſſe, which
increaſed with their injuries, and finding the people (not able
to conceale their love of His extraordinary virtues) openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
an honeſt pity of their much wronged Maſter, they
thought it neceſſary to give law to their feares, by uſurping His
power, and exerciſing it in their oppreſſion whom unwary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
towards their Soveraigne had made ſuſpected for loyall
Subjects. Accordingly all His Arms (and thoſe of the Kingdome
beſides, leaſt the people ſhould prevent their own wrongs by a
timely revenge of His) are ſeized on, &amp; they poſſeſſe themſelves
of His Forts, Caſtles, Townes, and Navy. After ſuch unparalell'd
uſurpations, Regall power being invaded by private hands, a
ſmall Guard of honeſt York-ſhire gentlemen attend the King
for His Perſonall ſafety, not knowing where their injuries
would ſtop, for the bonds of law being once ſhaken off, their
power to oppreſſe, or ruine, was as unbounded as their will;
by the ſame juſtice He was kept out of <hi>Hull,</hi> they might have
kept him in what Village, what Houſe, what Priſon they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
This Guard of a much ſmaller number then they had kept
together many Moneths was ſcornfully Voted an Army, and
Commiſſions are illegally iſſued out to raiſe Forces to ſuppreſſe
this <hi>ſecond</hi> Warre, made by the King upon Himſelfe. The
publique motive was feare of violence intended by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
the private encouragement to leſſe forward Souldiers was
the Kings inability to make the leaſt oppoſition. An Army is
levyed againſt Him upon publique pretence of His ſtrength,
and perſwaded to march againſt Him, upon their private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of His weakneſſe. Thouſands are liſted not to fight, but
travell, and are promiſed to know nothing of warre beſides the
wages, but to injoy the ſecurity and delights of a progreſſe.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52023:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
After all this (to prevent effuſion of bloud, and theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
calamities which the wild ambition of a few men, hath
pull'd upon their unhappy countrey) He twice ſues for Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in thoſe moſt gracious Meſſages from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with offer
of ſuch large conditions, that if more ſhould be required from
Him, though when conquered, the Subjects would be looſers
by it, and they would gaine that by a miſerable Warre, which
will much diminiſh the happineſſe of Peace. They will not
now deſcend to a Treaty with their King; they like His humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but are not well pleaſed it was not ſhewne ſooner: onely
ſome ſlender hopes are given, that their Generall ſhall have
commiſſion to pardon His former unwillingneſſe to ſuffer,
if He can redeeme thoſe errors which have put them to
expence and trouble, by a conſtant tameneſſe for the future.
From <hi>Nottingham</hi> he ſlyes to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (for they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to give Him line enough, being confident they can ſtrike
Him when they pleaſe; in the meane time, 'tis good ſport to
ſee Him wearying Himſelfe with fruitleſſe indeavous to eſcape,
when at laſt being tyred with long and vaine ſtrivings. He
muſt be forced to deliver Himſelfe quietly into their hands.</p>
               <p>Thus was he accuſed to be the aſſaulter, who was ſo long
time unable to reſiſt their violence. <hi>Ei fuit ſaluti, quòd vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur
certò periturus,</hi> his apparent weakneſſe did deliver him
from that power which was ready to ſwallow him up; they
had then deſtroyed him, if they had not beene more wanton,
then conſcientious.</p>
               <p>This narration is abundantly ſufficient to prove the warre to
be defenſive of the Kings part. But I will examine it further by
the rules of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> defines warre very accurately (preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the lawes of ſociety, and excluding private Duells) <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorum
armorum juſtam contentionem,</hi> a juſt diſpute of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
by publique ſwords, <hi>l. 1. c. 2. de jure bel.</hi> juſt, <hi>negante
ſenſu,</hi> for that which is not unjuſt, and in the law notion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
not to the cauſes, (for this is called <hi>pium bellum)</hi> but
the authors waging it. Wherefore he ſhewes, that it cannot be
but betweene independent States and Princes; Citizens or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52023:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Subjects cannot be lawfull enemies oppoſed to their Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they want ſupreme authority, without which the warre
is not publique, nor can it be juſtified. The reaſon is, becauſe
warre is only excuſed by neceſſity, that is, when there is no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
way to end controverſies by prohibiting farther appeales,
as amongſt diſtinct States, or ſeverall Princes, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no ſuperior, and are not bound to ſubmit to any Court,
and may perhaps not agree upon arbitrators, becauſe in ſome
caſes none can be named, who are uninterreſſed in the deciſion.
But I will not inſiſt upon the injuſtice of Subjects making war
for any cauſe whatever, upon the ſupreme power, becauſe this
was evidenced at large in the <hi>ſecond Section,</hi> where I proved,
that a liberty of reſiſtance, doth deſtroy the nature of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
or ſupremacy, and introduces <hi>regnum in regno, civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
in civitate,</hi> by dividing the civill power, which can be but
one, if the State or Kingdome be but one.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhall be the entrance into our iniquirie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the injuſtice of this preſent warre of the Subjects part
(ſetting aſide their duty of non-reſiſtance by divine law apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our conſtitutions, and ſuppoſing an equality or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
betweene King and Subjects) for want of a reaſonable
cauſe which might excuſe thoſe great miſchiefes, as being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
remedy to prevent greater. <hi>Homicidium quum admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt
ſinguli, crimen eſt, virtus vocatur, quum publicè geritur.</hi>
And there is ſome ground in reaſon, that ſhedding though the
bloud but of one man ſhould deſerve an ignominious death, and
to kill thouſands by publique authority ſhould make our lives
glorious. Becauſe there is as vaſt a difference, as betweene the
guilt of murtherers, and the gallantry of men undertaking the
adminiſtration of juſtice with perſonall hazard for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of publique rights. Firſt therefore a <hi>juriſdiction</hi> is required,
where lawes are wanting to make uſe of force for recovery of
right (which Subjects cannot have over their Prince) and this
doth make <hi>juſtum bellum.</hi> And ſecondly, a ſufficient cauſe is
neceſſary; there muſt be reaſonable motives, or elſe it cannot
be <hi>pium bellum.</hi> Except wee have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
wee commit murder with the ſword of juſtice. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52023:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Romans was to demand their rights in a peaceable
way by their Heralds, and in caſe reſtitution was denyed, then
warre was proclaimed, and the cauſe likewiſe declared, <hi>(nec
dederunt, nec ſolverunt, nec fecerunt, quas res dari, fieri, ſolvi
oportuit,</hi> as wee find in <hi>Livy)</hi> that the world might be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the innocence of their unwilling violence. So carefull
were they to preſerve their credit with mankind, whom it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
concerned, that warre ſhould not be waged upon
light and unjuſtifiable grounds. There muſt be <hi>belli cauſa gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi>
a ſober inducement to make the warre defenſive, and if
this were not wanting, reall injuries having beene offered; yet
if this cauſe were taken away, by an after readineſſe to make
full ſatisfaction, if the offended parties would not accept of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the warre was then eſteemed offenſive of their part,
and they became guilty before God for the cauſeleſſe effuſion
of ſo much bloud, and worthily infamous amongſt all good
men. <hi>Melior cauſa ad partem poenitentem tranſibat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To apply briefly theſe unqueſtionable rules of juſtice to the
preſent caſe: for I find that long reaſons doe as little ſatisfie
the common ſort, as none at all, they having but narrow me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
and it being the ſame thing not to know, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>I will put but one interrogatory to ſuch as take up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, <hi>Why they are Rebels and Traytors, cui bono?</hi>
(for that they are ſo, I appeale to the Judges of the Land, or
referre them to the plaine and evident Law, 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Let
them ſuppoſe themſelves arraigned, and the Judge to aske what
they can ſay for themſelves, why ſentence ſhould not paſſe for
their condemnation according to expreſſe law. Certainly they
could not make a fairer plea then the <hi>Earle of Eſſex,</hi> who had
not proceeded to offer violence to the Queene, and yet was
adjudged a Traytor for appearing in Armes, only with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to remove <hi>evill Counſellors.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>pretext</hi> is, in defence of Liberty, Lawes, Property, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament and Religion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>reall cauſe is,</hi> the preferment of a few ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who will not permit the Lawes to have their free and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52023:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uninterrupted courſe, the knowne ſecurity of the Subjects hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
becauſe the orderly adminiſtration of juſtice doth not
ſignifie, that the King will beſtow ſuch offices upon them, as
their inordinate deſires aime at. He cannot doubt the truth of
this, who hath read and obſerved the conditions without
which they will not ſuffer peace, and to compaſſe which His
Majeſty hath left no reaſonable wayes unattempted. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
He hath offered ſo much to His Subjects as would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
honeſt and moderate conquerours.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Lawes,</hi> there ſhall not be any other meaſure of
mens actions, beſides thoſe knowne rules. Neither Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
nor fellow Subjects Ordinances ſhall make the
people miſerable under an Arbitrary ſway. Doe you deſire to
be as happy as your progenitors? you ſhall. For you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all the ſame lawes by the benefits wherof they lived peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
plentifully, gloriouſly. And beſides this for a futher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of your happineſſe, all thoſe new Lawes enacted
this Parliament, and the ſeverall additional favours by parting
with many knowne rights, (which exceed the Acts of Grace
from all His Royall Anceſtors though put together) ſhall be
confirmed to you.</p>
               <p>Doe you deſire to be as free as your Anceſtors? you ſhall.
His Majeſty paſſionately requires the Liberty of the Subject
ſhould be reſtored, and will take care the people ſhall not looſe
their birth-right, by being impriſoned upon His, or, which is
worſe, their fellow Subjects illegall diſpleaſure. He will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
His utmoſt endeavours, that His owne Caſtles, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
houſes, and all other not long ſince honeſt habitations,
may be diſgaoled, and the Engliſh may be againe acquainted
with the comfort of life, freedome of their perſons, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and not be baniſhed from their Wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for preſuming to make the Lawes the rule of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>Doe you deſire the eſtabliſhment of your Property? you
ſhall have it. His Majeſty challenges no right to your eſtates,
and is unwilling Subjects ſhould claime a priviledge to take
them from you, only that they may be better inabled to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52023:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His. No pretences of unknowne dangers, or unſeene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
ſhall juſtifie the violation of Lawes, which alone can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your inheritances.</p>
               <p>Doe you deſire Priviledges of Parliament ſhould ſuffer no
diminution? They ſhall enjoy them in as high a way, as the
Subject in the freeſt and moſt happy dayes ever challenged.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that Religion which was ſealed with the bloud
of many holy Martyrs ſince the Reformation, and which ſtands
eſtabliſhed by Acts of Parliaments, and flouriſhed in the pureſt
times of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which no ſober man can thinke
guilty of any inclination to Popery, ſhall be confirmed to you
by an impartiall execution of all legall penaltyes appoynted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
offenders.</p>
               <p>Thus whatever can reaſonably be pleaded for, is cheerfully
offer'd to us, and wee are wooed to accept, what the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of our ruine pretend is fought for, Lawes, Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
Priviledges of Parliament and Religion.</p>
               <p>Would you have ſecurity for performance of this promiſed
happineſſe? you ſhall have as great as in juſtice you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
or in reaſon expect; the ſame ſecurity with which the
modeſty and wiſdome of former Parliaments were fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the Kingdome injoyed the benefits of their well
grounded confidence.</p>
               <p>And to compleat all, you ſhall have certaine proviſion for a
Trienniall Parliament. We are reſtored to ſuch a high degree of
health, as our Fathers were never acquainted with, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuch a courſe is taken to time this State Phiſique (it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended Parliaments ſhould be our conſtant diet) as will
probably prevent future diſtempers.</p>
               <p>What fury hath robb'd men of their underſtandings, that they
cannot be perſwaded to be happy! that their malice ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
with their calamities! that they ſhould hate, and teare,
and kill one another they know not why! For upon my ſoule
a great part of their army would not impoſe upon others, nor
admit themſelves of the Browniſts, or Anabaptiſts Creeds; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would they thinke this Kingdome unhappy (ſo they might
get ſome honeſt imployment, as honourable opportunities
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52023:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would not be wanting in forraigne nations, if we had once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
our former reputation, with that wealth and quiet we
lately injoyed) though 8 or 10 men ſhould looſe their miſchiefes,
and not get thoſe offices, which they valued, above the riches,
and quiet and honour of their nation.</p>
               <p>What one thing hath His Majeſtie denyed them, which hee
had not full right ſo to do? And, <hi>qui jure ſuo utitur, nemini in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriam
facit;</hi> except they can alleadge <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
injuries offerd to them, and a refuſall to give ſatisfaction,
the warre is manifeſtly unjuſt on their ſide; wee at the worſt
ſhall fall martyrs, and they at beſt will live murtherers, all
the bloud which hath beene ſhed will be brought in upon their
accompt, all thoſe rapines and ſacriledges, the robbing God,
and men will lye upon their heads.</p>
               <p>In matters of Law he hath not rejected any thing, and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of meere grace and favour, he hath beene bountifull above
all his royall Anceſtors, and ſo extreamely tender is he in giving
all content to His two Houſes, that he could not prevaile with
himſelfe to deny, but he reſerves his aſſent till ſuch time, as they
can ſhew him ſome reaſonable motive, whereby he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to grant.</p>
               <p>As he hath been conſtant in his love and proſecution of peace,
ſo he hath taken extraordinary paines in ſolliciting His Houſes
to cut off the unneceſſary injuries of war, by laying down plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings
and other cauſeleſſe violences committed upon Eſtates
or perſons on both ſides, his Royall heart bleeding even for the
unavoidable preſſures the people have pull'd upon themſelves.
His Souldiers will rule their actions by the counſell of <hi>John</hi> the
Baptiſt, and be content with their wages, and cheerfully hazard
their lives in defence of ſo honeſt a cauſe, by as honeſt meanes.
If they are not able to pay their Army, what ſecret moath and
canker hath conſumed that vaſt treaſure? Their want of money
is a great argument of the unſearcheable judgment of God, who
can make them ſtill poore, though they take a liberty to ſeize
the wealth of the Kingdome. O that the people would but
yet conſider how unlikely it is the State can thrive hereafter
under ſuch Stewards!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52023:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He that ſadly calls to mind the height of happineſſe from
which wee are lately falne, all paſt grievances being fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyed,
and future preſſures probably prevented, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
how often His Majeſty hath intreated, importuned us to
accept againe of that bleſſed condition, may well wonder, that
our calamities ſhould yet continue, that they ſhould hourely
grow upon us. I would willingly baniſh from my thoughts
thoſe melancholly obſervations of Hiſtorians, <hi>Quos Deus
vult perdere, prius dementes facit,</hi> and <hi>Quorum fortunam Deus
mutare conſtituit, conſilia corrumpit.</hi> But they have ſo ſtrongly
poſſeſt my fancy, that I am almoſt tempted to feare, ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
loſſe of mens reaſon, is but the fatall forerunner of an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall
deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Our condition ſtands thus; though the King hath not yet,
nor ever will hereafter deny any thing of right, (thoſe deſires
which are regulated by lawes ſhall be no ſooner preſented to
Him, then granted) and though he hath indulged extreamely
much of favour (more then our Fathers had the boldneſſe to
crave) nevertheleſſe wee cannot prevaile with our ſelves to
injoy ſo great bleſſings, unleſſe He will conſent likewiſe to
their other requeſts, ſome of which He may thinke He is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not to paſſe in juſtice, there being no light motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Him to beleeve, He hath ſworne againſt it, at His Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and ſome, He cannot grant with honour, and without
betraying that truſt committed to Him by God and the Law for
the benefit and protection of His people.</p>
               <p>He is deſired of ſigne the Bill for abolition of Epiſcopacy
(that which acquainted this Land with Chriſtianity) and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the Rights of the Church, and take away Eccleſiaſticall
revenues, that He may be remembred in ſtory, as the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
inſtrument to pull downe what the charity of many ages
hath beene building, and to deſtroy many pious Monuments and
glorious teſtimonies of our forefathers chriſtianity, and to
ruine what the devotion of our godly Anceſtors hath contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
for the encouragement of learning and advancement
of Religion.</p>
               <p>To ſay nothing to the politique part, how the Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52023:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Civill State are ſo interwoven, that the foundation of the
whole may thereby be ſhaken, and how there are very good
reaſons to ſuſpect a Presbyteriall Government will prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
prejudiciall to Monarchy; I ſhall ſpeake only to the
religion of this requeſt. And firſt, I would willingly know,
whether there be ſuch a ſinne, as wee have hitherto uſed to call
Sacriledge (ſo ſeverely puniſhed upon the Heathens, the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things dedicated to falſe Deities, being notoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
by the true God, and ſo extreamly abhorr'd by all good
Chriſtians in former ages) and then, whether Magiſtrates have
any diſpenſation to commit Sacriledge innocently, by which
private men incurre a laſting infamie, and eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I would willingly be ſatisfied in this <hi>Quaere,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King having ſworne to preſerve the Rights and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the Church intire, can innocently conſent (ſuppoſing
Him fully informed in the nature of that right which belongs
to His Clergy, for the moſt religious Prince may be ſubject to
miſtake) to leſſen or abrogate them, except releaſed by the
conſent of that Body, to whom He is obliged? This poynt
rightly ſtated (I ſhall only offer it to be ſeriouſly meditated on,
without any peremptory determination) may confirme, the
Lands of the Church for the future to the great improvement
of our civill happineſſe. For (beſides that wee might reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
promiſe to our ſelves a bleſſing from the Almighty, if wee
ſhew our ſelves as carefull, to ſetle thoſe Rights which tend to
the advancement of his worſhip by a firme eſtabliſhment of a

by making proviſion, that no mans Rights ſhall be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
without the owners conſents) a great temptation, and
that which ſeemes to have the ſtrongeſt influence in all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of innovation, would thereby be cut off, the hopes of
repairing their decayed fortunes with the ſpoyls of the Church,
Wee ſhall find in ſtories, that moſt of thoſe ſtormes which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
former calmes, and by which this Kingdome ſundry
times hath beene miſerably ſhaken, were raiſed only with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52023:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſinke the Church by ſuch as promiſed to themſelves
conſiderable ſhares in the wreck.</p>
               <p>Some anſwer; He is equally ſworne to the obſervation of
Lawes, but theſe He may alter, with advice of both Houſes.
Thus one, <hi>I doe not conceive Him more bound to defend them by
His Oath, then the reſt of the Lawes enacted, any of which when
the Kingdome deſires ſhould be abrogated, I hope is done without
perjury.</hi> That which is commonly called the Lawyers <hi>Anſwer
to D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ferne.</hi> p. 31. This doth by no meanes take of my ſcruple,
becauſe His Oath to defend the Lawes enacted, is made <hi>populo
Anglicano,</hi> to His people, and ſo (as all other promiſes by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the partyes to whom a right was transferred) may be,
and really is forgiven by them repreſented in Parliament to that
purpoſe. But this other Oath is made to ſuch a part of His
people, <hi>Clero Anglicano,</hi> and particularly taken by Him after
His Oath to the whole Realme, which were needleſſe, except
it meant ſome other obligation. This ſeemes to prove it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Oath, and not releaſable without their conſent. Upon
the ſame grounds that theſe Rights are pleaded voyd, if Voted
downe, notwithſtanding they to whom they belonged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
not their will to part with them, the ſtrongeſt ſecurity
<hi>England</hi> can give is weakned and diſcredited, that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of the Kingdome to repay ſuch ſums by conſent of
King and Lords and Commons, which and which only is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith. In ſuch a caſe, can the City be Voted payd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they willingly releaſe the debt? if they ſhould be told,
their rights are not ſtronger then lawes, but theſe are made null
at the deſire of the Kingdome in Parliament, they would ſoone
apprehend their logique to be extreamely faultie, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
they would maintaine, that the repreſentative Kingdome
in Parliament cannot diſpenſe with the Kings obligation to a
particular body of His Subjects, in whom alone the power of
releaſement doth lye.</p>
               <p>He is deſired to nominate ſuch Officers to manage the great
affaires of ſtate, as they ſhall confide in; that is to yeild up
His undoubted right, happily enjoyed by all His Royall Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
into their diſpoſall, and to determine His choice by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52023:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feares. If they will confide in thoſe, whom the lawes
doe not diſtruſt, the King hath ſatisfied even this requeſt, for
he will not preferre any againſt whom they can bring juſt and
legall exceptions. But he thinks it no good argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to turne able honeſt Miniſters (who may challenge
from His accuſtomed goodneſſe that priviledge of <hi>quàm diu ſe
bene geſſerint)</hi> meerly becauſe others deſire to have their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They themſelves would conceive it very hard uſage to be
put out againe upon the ſame title, when no legall exceptions
were produced againſt them, and therefore they preſſe His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to ſecure them (when once in) by law, and yet will not
permit him to be ruled by their advice out of equity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to
continue His favours to thoſe men, who by a faithfull diſcharge
of their places, have ſhewed themſelves worthy of that truſt;
if it will be reaſonable then, it is ſo now, to encourage faithfull
ſervants by making their owne offences only, and not other
mens <hi>feares,</hi> the rule by which they ſhall ſuffer. <hi>Nemo illis ſic
timere permiſit.</hi> They might as well tell the world in plaine
engliſh (but that advantages are ſtill made of the peoples blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
<hi>except the King will grant ſuch preferments to us and our
favorites</hi> (for let Him nominate whom He will, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
confide, unleſſe He guide His nomination by their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
who are to approve them, and the truth is, when they
have gained one, He hath reaſon to requeſt them to take the
other, for they will ſave Him the trouble of naming in vaine,
and He may thereby conceale His hurtfull affection, and not
expoſe His beſt friends to diſhonourable repulſes) <hi>except wee
may be Patrons</hi> (they would once have been contented to be
onely the preſent incumbents, and ſuffer Him to retaine the
right to beſtow them freely for the future time) <hi>wee ſhall never
indure peace, and yet wee muſt be forced to caſt the envy of ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
a warre upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All underſtanding and diſ-intereſſed perſons muſt clearely
diſcerne, it is the ſame injuſtice, not to conſent, the people
ſhould be happy, and to keep up theſe publique calamities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untill
they ſhall be ſatisfied in their illegall, unreaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls.
Though it be a more politique way, <hi>duris conditionibus
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52023:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pacem pati velle,</hi> to expreſſe a deſire of peace, but not to admit it,
but upon unequitable and unjuſt conditions, yet it is equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſt,
as to deny it downeright. They are altogether inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,
unleſſe they will make ſuch propoſals, whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
they covet not anothers, but only to preſerve their owne
rights. Which the King freely offers to them without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the leaſt title, and with unpreſidented enlargements by
many additionall favours in this preſent Parliament.</p>
               <p>He is deſired to make the Houſes ſharers with him in orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to grant them a right to ſuppreſſe all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but ſuch as ſhall be raiſed by their conſent.</p>
               <p>This requeſt is evidently deſtructive of that fundamentall
Law, which intruſts this power in the Crowne alone to enable
the King to protect His Subjects and the Lawes. The benefits
of which conſtitution our happy Anceſtors enjoyed, and the
greateſt preſſures the Engliſh nation at any time ſuffered under,
did ſpring from this fountaine, when Subjects undertooke the
managery of this regall right.</p>
               <p>Becauſe their deſire is diſcountenanced by Law (and being ſo
though it were as really beneficiall, as it is truely pernicious to
the peace and quiet of a State, opening a gap to civill diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
neceſſarily ariſing from the oppoſite intereſts of conſorts in
power; though it might be reaſonably wiſhed, yet it cannot be
innocently fought for) They endeavour to juſtifie it by reaſon
of State, and plead the neceſſity of it, as being the onely cure of
<hi>feares</hi> and <hi>jealouſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The recovery of this Kingdome were certainely deſperate,
if His Majeſty too ſhould grow fearefull and jealous, who hath
beene more unanſwerably tempted to give admitance to theſe
unhappy paſſions. For if they might ſeize on his power by the
Law of feares, if that it is taken from him, becomes a motive to
perſwade him to give them right to keepe it, might not he with
greater ſhew of reaſon, require an inlargement of his former
power, becauſe it is manifeſt (though they pretended to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it) it was not able to ſecure him from their violence.
Much more might be pleaded, why he ſhould be enabled to
keepe, what the Law gives him, then they not to reſtore what
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52023:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have illegally taken from him. But he contents himſelfe
with the ordinary meanes of ſafety appointed by Law, and will
not make himſelfe juſtly formidable, by giving entertainement
to unjuſt feares, and challenging a priviledge to doe injuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not impoſſible, he may ſuffer them, and may looſe his
owne rights, except he diſable others by invading theirs. If this
principle ſhould once prevaile, peace and juſtice were loſt to
mankinde; for it would ſtill be ſome-bodies turne to be afraid,
and that would give them a right to greater power, which right
would ceaſe as ſoone as they were poſſeſt of it, and the true title
to power would alwaies be in thoſe who wanted it. There is
no other way to get out of this maze and confuſion, to which
their wild feares inavoydably betray a State, but by prevailing
with our reaſon, not to ſuſpect thoſe whom the Lawes have not
ſuſpected. For as jealouſies againſt Law are cauſeleſſe, ſo they
are altogether remedileſſe. <hi>The fuller anſwer to Doctor Ferne,</hi>
endeavours to excuſe them by vertue of a commiſſion from this
principle, <hi>abundans cautela non nocet,</hi> but wofull experience
hath evidenced the contrary; he tells us further, <hi>State jealouſie
hath no right hand error, none on the exceſſe ſide, the more the better.

but the miſery of a family, that the unhappineſſe of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all, though ſome have gone ſo farre, to indulge
to Subjects a liberty to take up armes in maintenance of <hi>old laws,</hi>
yet no ſober author can be produced, who makes it lawfull to
fight againſt their Soveraigne for the eſtabliſhment of <hi>new laws.</hi>
It is not poſſible a ſtrong deſire of innovation ſhould take off the
guilt of ſo unnaturall a warre.</p>
               <p>The King requires nothing but (what the Subject cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
without injuſtice, without perjury, and conſequently, the
guilt of all that bloud which is, or ſhall, or might be ſpilt,) his
knowne legall rights, and he denies nothing which the Subject
can by Law challenge, and hath indulged ſo much of grace, as all
ages cannot paralell, and yet is ſtill ready to conſent farther, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reaſons ſhall be produced to invite greater favours.</p>
               <p>How will poſterity hate this example, and bluſh at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

Kings by theſe ungratefull requitalls of ſuch eminent deſervings
towards his people! If we had not with our peace, and plenty,
and innocence, loſt our reaſon too, we ſhould quickely be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to accept of ſo great happineſſe, and not perverſely
hazard an ignominious death, onely to make our lives miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
How are we become beaſts in our underſtanding, as if
onely capable to ſuffer without any apprehenſion of the cauſes
or remedies.</p>
               <p>The reſult of all is; life and death are ſet before the people,
it is in their election to be againe happy, but they choſe theſe
miſerable things and are active in their owne ruine. For
it will come to that, if they ſtop not in their wild pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe,
The husbandmans ſtore being conſumed, the paſtures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocked,
though wee eſcape the ſword or bullet, wee ſhall be
devoured by famine, or elſe periſh by plagues, or fluxes, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
productions of unholſome dyet.</p>
               <p>It concernes us to pray unto Almighty God that he would
be pleaſed to reſtore us to our wits, for if he would make us
wiſe, wee ſhould ſoone make our ſelves happy, by bringing
the pernicious authors of theſe our miſeries to a legall tryall;
wee ſhould then clearely ſee, that the preferment of a few men
ought not ſo to ſway with us, that wee ſhould ſacrifice our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Property, and ſuffer the Lawes to be violated, the
Proteſtant Religion to be diſhonoured, only in order to ſatisfie
ſome particular mens ambition. That indignation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Virgil</hi> (ingaged in a miſerable warre, to gaine that with
bloud and ruine, the want whereof was no diminution to their
happineſſe) would too well fit the <hi>Engliſh nation,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Scilicet ut Turno contingat Regia conjux,</l>

Muſt wee dye like dogs, that they may live like princes! How
are the <hi>oppreſſed commons</hi> concerned in thoſe mens illegall gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
that they ſhould be contented to looſe their eſtates, and

that His Majeſty will not permit us to be leſſe happy then our
